1
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:37,958
INDIAN AIRLINES

2
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,458
I've tried everything I could.

3
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,291
PM's under immense pressure.

4
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,291
ISI has fed the international
media the story

5
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:52,750
that our negotiations
have completely failed.

6
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,333
And the terrorists could,
at any moment,

7
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,875
kill the passengers sitting on that plane.

8
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,041
Sir, you know that's not true.

9
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,000
These bastards are about to break.

10
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:06,500
From asking for 36 terrorists
to be released,

11
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,000
they've now come down to just three.

12
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,041
Sir, give me a little more time,

13
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,291
and I promise you we won't have
to release a single terrorist...

14
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,666
and we'll get every passenger
back home safe and sound.

15
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,416
It's just a question of time.

16
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,250
For the past three days,
the hostages' families

17
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,750
have been protesting
outside the PM residence.

18
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:27,750
Unfortunately, this is it.

19
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,041
<i>Come on...</i>

20
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,250
<i>Get out of here!</i>

21
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,375
<i>- Get him!
- Grab the bastard.</i>

22
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,625
Thrash him!

23
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,375
<i>Slit his throat.</i>

24
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,791
<i>Get up.</i>

25
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,125
<i>Slit his throat.</i>

26
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,250
<i>Hold him down.</i>

27
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:51,791
Zahoor, we won't negotiate at gunpoint.

28
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,416
So, what have you guys decided?

29
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,625
We have conferred with our Prime Minister.

30
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,750
Tomorrow, all three of them...
Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar,

31
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,708
Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh,

32
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,500
and your brother,
Maulana Masood Azhar,

33
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:19,333
will be released from prison
and handed over to you here in Kandahar.

34
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:23,833
What about the money?

35
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,375
By tonight, ten million dollars
will be transferred...

36
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,583
to your contact in Dubai.

37
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,166
Now I want to speak
to the passengers, alone.

38
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,166
Attention, everyone.

39
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,416
You may now remove your blindfolds

40
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,916
and open the window shades.

41
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,625
Please don't worry.

42
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,250
{\an8}I'm Ajay Sanyal,
Chief of India's Intelligence Bureau.

43
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,208
{\an8}I'm pleased to inform you

44
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,333
{\an8}that our negotiations
have been successful.

45
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,291
By tomorrow evening, all of you

46
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,208
will be returning safely to India.

47
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:39,125
Our nation will forever remain
grateful for your courage

48
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,916
and resilience during this difficult time.

49
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,875
Glory to...

50
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,750
Glory to...

51
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,291
Glory indeed.

52
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,458
You Hindus are a bunch of cowards, yes?

53
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:36,750
Mr. Intelligence,
we'd better get our money by tonight.

54
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,416
Wasn't your land once
called the "Golden Bird"?

55
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,666
{\an8}Tonight, we strip it of its gold,

56
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,500
{\an8}tomorrow, the bird
will be gone for good.

57
00:07:58,833 --> 00:07:59,750
Mr. Sanyal...

58
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,250
we live just across the border, you know.

59
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,458
If you think you've the balls,

60
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,375
{\an8}go ahead. Do your worst.

61
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:22,875
Sir, please don't take this personally,

62
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,958
{\an8}but apart from you, the rest of our

63
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,041
{\an8}negotiation team is completely
inexperienced.

64
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,041
Even if our commandos
had stormed that plane,

65
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,166
it would've been a better strategy
for India's reputation.

66
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,250
So you're telling me

67
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,166
it's a "better strategy"
to risk 160 lives just

68
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,250
to protect our country's reputation?

69
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,166
I've handled this kind
of situation before.

70
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,041
And let's be frank, sir,

71
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,333
our country's not prepared
to handle this kind of adversity.

72
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,458
So then we'd better start preparing.

73
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:54,750
We've exhausted every other option anyway.

74
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,791
We begged the UN,

75
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,416
we pleaded with the US,

76
00:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,583
and they laughed at every
diplomatic solution we offered.

77
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,166
Sir, I'm sorry, I'm being rather blunt,
but I have no choice.

78
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,166
They barged into Kashmir, Kargil.

79
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,916
Next, it'll be Hyderabad,

80
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:11,666
and all we'll do is stand around
singing patriotic songs.

81
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,041
Sir, to land a punch,
you must first make a fist.

82
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,833
We must infiltrate the very core
of terrorism in Pakistan.

83
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,750
So if they even dream of harming India...

84
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,500
we should be waiting for them there,
like a nightmare.

85
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,041
And sir, I have a unique plan
to make that happen.

86
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,333
Come on, Sanyal,
what are you on about?

87
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,208
The whole world saw your plan fail
spectacularly in Kandahar.

88
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,458
You handle Indian Intelligence,

89
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,083
let me handle the international side.

90
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,250
Sir, did I share my Kashmir doctrine
with you?

91
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,916
Now that's what I call
"Hope for Peace."

92
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,875
<i>What's the good news, ma'am?</i>

93
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,958
My husband just got a job
as a security guard at SBI.

94
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,500
- Congratulations, ma'am.
- You too have some.

95
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:00,916
Remember, I told you about it earlier?

96
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,833
- Congratulations, madam.
- Come here. Thank you.

97
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,291
- When did he get the job?
- Today.

98
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,791
- I'm throwing a party tonight.
- Slow down.

99
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,916
Sir, sir, sir! Stop!

100
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,541
{\an8}Sir, please stop.

101
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,708
- Hold that for me, will you?
- Sure.

102
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,625
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop the car!

103
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,125
Stop!

104
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,541
Yadav, that car's going way over
the speed limit... stop it!

105
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,958
Shut all the doors of Parliament,
now! Hurry!

106
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,500
- It's heading towards the VVIP gate!
- Stop it!

107
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,500
The car's crashed near Gate No. 11!

108
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,000
Close every entrance
to the Parliament, quick!

109
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Do it now!

110
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,125
<i>At approximately 11:40 a.m.,</i>

111
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,416
<i>a suicide assault team of
terrorists attacked the Parliament.</i>

112
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,625
<i>This car had a red beacon
and a Home Ministry sticker on it.</i>

113
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,375
<i>Operation! Operation! Commander!</i>

114
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,625
<i>We can hear gunfire near Gate No. 1.</i>

115
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:00,166
<i>They came in guns blazing.
shooting down the security guards.</i>

116
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,000
<i>We can still hear gunshots from inside.</i>

117
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,041
{\an8}<i>An attempt to halt
an ongoing attack was made</i>

118
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,416
<i>in the area surrounding Gate No.1.</i>

119
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:15,791
<i>The terrorists had brought a massive
load of explosives with them.</i>

120
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,041
<i>One of them, a human bomb,</i>

121
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,625
<i>went in and blew himself up.</i>

122
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,375
<i>The blast was so powerful...</i>

123
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:38,666
<i>his remains are still stuck to the roof.</i>

124
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,833
<i>His remains are scattered over there.</i>

125
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,208
Status?

126
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,916
We've got five terrorists.

127
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,500
{\an8}- Inside or outside?
- Outside, thankfully.

128
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,625
{\an8}The parliament session was
adjourned 40 minutes ago.

129
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,250
{\an8}The MPs who are still here

130
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,500
have been safely locked down
on the parliament floor.

131
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:56,791
We've got fresh intel...

132
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,791
One of the IC814 hijackers,

133
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,958
Sunny Qazi was leading this attack.

134
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,875
He's been neutralized along
with three others.

135
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,416
We have to get it right every time,

136
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,291
but these bastards have
to get it right just once.

137
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,125
Doctor, her pulse is very weak.

138
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,333
We are losing her. She needs blood.

139
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,041
The parliament attack has rattled
the government to its core.

140
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,958
No one ever imagined they'd barge
straight into our territory.

141
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,416
The Prime Minister's pretty worried.

142
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,625
He's losing patience.

143
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,166
Sometimes losing patience
can be good for a country.

144
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,666
I finally went through the file
you gave me.

145
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,833
Two years too late.

146
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,416
Those are some pretty radical ideas.

147
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:05,958
It's going to take ages
to win over the Middle East.

148
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:10,708
And it's quite difficult to push Pakistan
into bankruptcy right now,

149
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,958
because the US is backing them.

150
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,000
However...

151
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,166
There's one proposal the PM liked.

152
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,166
Dhurandhar.

153
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,625
Dhurandhar.

154
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,000
However, the PM was concerned...

155
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,083
if such a long-term plan
will even work?

156
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:31,833
We have no choice.

157
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,666
We've got to start somewhere, sometime.

158
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,041
Because today they've
only crossed our threshold,

159
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,791
but tomorrow they'll pin
us down by the throat,

160
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,458
then we'll have nothing left to lose,

161
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,125
neither patience nor courage.

162
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,166
I will make it happen.

163
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,000
Cheers to Dhurandhar.

164
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,958
Cheers to Dhurandhar.

165
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,458
{\an8}<i>Sunlight shattered down</i>

166
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,500
{\an8}<i>Like broken glass in the sky</i>

167
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:21,541
<i>If it cut me now, so what?</i>

168
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,750
<i>I'll take it in my stride</i>

169
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,083
<i>My heart lies shattered...</i>

170
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:33,833
<i>I came here leaving
My love scorched and tattered</i>

171
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,708
{\an8}<i>My heart lies shattered...</i>

172
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:46,375
{\an8}<i>I came here leaving
My love scorched and tattered</i>

173
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,958
{\an8}<i>Into the sky I soar</i>

174
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,875
{\an8}<i>And my heart exhilarates some more</i>

175
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,000
{\an8}<i>My heart lies shattered...</i>

176
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,083
{\an8}<i>In my passion lies my peace</i>

177
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:09,541
{\an8}<i>My heart is now obsessed it seems</i>

178
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,916
{\an8}<i>I've come like a storm untamed</i>

179
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:21,291
{\an8}<i>Even my courage can't be chained</i>

180
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:25,625
{\an8}<i>Neither am I seeking a caravan</i>

181
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:29,583
{\an8}<i>Neither am I seeking a caravan</i>

182
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:33,916
{\an8}<i>Nor am I seeking a companion</i>

183
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:37,916
{\an8}<i>Neither am I seeking a caravan</i>

184
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,041
{\an8}<i>My heart lies shattered...</i>

185
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:51,666
{\an8}<i>My eyes speak half my tale</i>

186
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:58,750
{\an8}<i>My eyes speak half my tale</i>

187
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,000
{\an8}<i>The rest my silence will unveil</i>

188
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,250
{\an8}<i>I'm searching for someone
Who feels the same</i>

189
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:10,125
{\an8}<i>Neither am I seeking a caravan</i>

190
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,666
{\an8}- Where's this bus headed?
- To Lahore.

191
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,625
{\an8}Lahore?

192
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,500
{\an8}- Where's this bus headed?
- To Karachi.

193
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,625
{\an8}- Karachi.
- Via Peshawar.

194
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,458
{\an8}<i>Nor am I seeking a companion</i>

195
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,375
{\an8}<i>This land walks with me wherever I stand</i>

196
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:51,541
{\an8}<i>This land walks with me wherever I stand</i>

197
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:55,666
{\an8}<i>And the sky now rests within my hand</i>

198
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:59,791
{\an8}<i>Neither am I seeking a caravan</i>

199
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,875
{\an8}<i>Nor am I seeking a companion</i>

200
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:11,791
{\an8}<i>Neither am I seeking a caravan</i>

201
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,541
{\an8}<i>My heart lies shattered...</i>

202
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,291
{\an8}<i>I came here leaving
My love scorched and tattered</i>

203
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:32,291
{\an8}<i>Neither am I seeking a caravan</i>

204
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:40,791
{\an8}<i>Nor am I seeking a companion</i>

205
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,458
<i>Darling, darling
Why did you break my heart?</i>

206
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,125
<i>Drink Aalam milk soda
And get a fresh start!</i>

207
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,833
<i>Darling, darling
Why did you break my heart?</i>

208
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,875
<i>Drink Aalam milk soda
And get a fresh start!</i>

209
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:04,000
{\an8}<i>Darling, darling
Why did you break my heart?</i>

210
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,375
<i>Drink Aalam milk soda
And get a fresh start!</i>

211
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:14,250
{\an8}Milk soda...
just twenty rupees a glass!

212
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,375
<i>- Drink Aalam milk soda!</i>
- Thank you.

213
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,708
{\an8}<i>Darling, darling
Why did you break my heart?</i>

214
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,375
{\an8}<i>Drink Aalam milk soda
And make a fresh start!</i>

215
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,208
Milk soda...
just twenty rupees a glass!

216
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,125
<i>Salam alaykum.</i>

217
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,666
<i>Wa'alaykumu s-salam.</i>

218
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,333
Can I get a job here?

219
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,958
No, man, you can
only get juice here.

220
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,041
I'm from Hindukush.

221
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,625
Just leave, dude.
Come back after Eid.

222
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:53,666
Where's the salt?

223
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:04,000
Just twenty rupees a glass!
Milk soda... Milk soda...

224
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,041
<i>Pashtun or Baloch.</i>

225
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,000
He looks like a Baloch.

226
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,875
Beautiful.

227
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,125
Damn... This is the elixir of life!

228
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,125
Hold him down!

229
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,291
Hold him down!

230
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,458
Strip him. Strip him.

231
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,250
Police!
Police! Run!

232
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,125
- Let's go.
- Let's go already!

233
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,000
Hey...

234
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:18,875
Wake up, kid.

235
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,000
Come on, sit up.

236
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,083
Wake up.

237
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,291
Take it slow, easy now.

238
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,208
Here.

239
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,458
What's your name?

240
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:47,791
Hamza.

241
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,208
Hamza Ali Mazari.

242
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,750
Your name, kid?

243
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,791
Hamza Ali Mazari.

244
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,541
Keep swirling the whole pot,
keep rotating it like this.

245
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,458
Yeah, keep swirling it.

246
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,958
Pour it from a little higher,
or the milk will split.

247
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,000
Pick this up and keep
it in the storeroom.

248
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,125
All good?

249
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:32,291
Fool, you'll break it or what?

250
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,416
Move it slowly.

251
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,166
Like this, slowly.

252
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,083
Enjoy.

253
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:59,250
<i>On behalf of Rehman Baloch,
wishing Lyari a blessed Ramadan.</i>

254
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:03,083
Everyone will get it, please be patient.

255
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,000
<i>Keep us in your prayers, Lyari.</i>

256
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,291
Our profession's most lethal weapons

257
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,416
<i>are vigilance and patience.</i>

258
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,666
<i>Keep them razor-sharp at all times.</i>

259
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:56,083
<i>Your goal isn't just
to slip into Pakistan,</i>

260
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,000
<i>your goal is to dominate
the whole jungle.</i>

261
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:09,583
Want to have some tea?

262
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:14,875
This was the first place
I worked after I came to Lyari.

263
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,125
I slept on benches for six years.

264
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,875
I washed glasses for six years

265
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,041
to build my network.

266
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,416
<i>Salam alaykum,</i> Butt <i>sahab.</i>

267
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,708
<i>Wa'alaykumu s-salam.</i>

268
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,208
- All good?
- All good.

269
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,458
Butt <i>sahab</i> puts salt in his tea.

270
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,416
People here find it disgusting.

271
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:35,250
But I like it.

272
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,166
Back in our village,
we only got salty water,

273
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,041
so our tea always tasted salty.

274
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,458
His tea reminds me of home.

275
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:47,875
Where are you from?

276
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:58,250
It won't be easy to get
into Rehman Dakait's gang.

277
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,041
You might have to wait...

278
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,333
for a long time.

279
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,750
All the gangs in Lyari stick

280
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,958
to their own communities.

281
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:10,583
You're Baloch,

282
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:13,666
so you can only join
Rehman Baloch's crew.

283
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:16,416
Watch out for the Pathan gang.

284
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,791
Babu Dakait and Arshad Pappu's men
are always prowling around.

285
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,166
Like the other night.

286
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:28,208
Rehman Dakait, Babu Dakait?

287
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:31,083
They've got the same last name?

288
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:36,916
Word in Lyari is that Rehman's
actually Babu Dakait's illegitimate son.

289
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:42,291
The day Rehman found out was
the day his mother died.

290
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:47,000
They say Rehman killed his
mother in a fit of rage.

291
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:57,041
<i>It has been a long time</i>

292
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:03,833
<i>But I still remember it very well</i>

293
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:08,041
<i>I still...</i>

294
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:27,208
Hey, dickhead!

295
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:29,708
Hey, you, open the till.
Give me all the money.

296
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:32,166
Looks like you're getting comfy
in Rehman's pants.

297
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,208
Babu <i>bhai,</i>

298
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:38,333
Rehman <i>bhai</i> asked me
to set up a stall at his kid's birthday.

299
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:40,458
- How could I say no?
- Where is it?

300
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:42,250
- Come on, speak up!
- No, don't know...

301
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,208
- You know whose turf...
- Open the till and hand me the money!

302
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:46,416
you're working in, right?

303
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,125
Go there again,

304
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,333
and I'll cut your nuts
so bad you'll piss through

305
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,958
a plastic pipe for the rest of your life.

306
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,250
Buzz off now.

307
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,833
Where'd you get
this delicious eye candy from?

308
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:16,833
{\an8}- Lulli.
- Yeah, <i>bhai.</i>

309
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:17,875
{\an8}Let's go.

310
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:19,500
{\an8}Let's bounce.

311
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,750
Lulli, let's go already.

312
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:33,208
Yeah, <i>bhai.</i>

313
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,666
After Babu Dakait suffered
a paralysis attack,

314
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,833
he teamed up with Arshad Pappu

315
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:54,750
to take on Rehman Baloch.

316
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:58,333
To this day, Arshad Pappu

317
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:01,416
and Babu Dakait control
about a third of Lyari.

318
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:07,541
Rehman won't be at tomorrow's
wedding reception,

319
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,333
but his son Naieem will be.

320
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:11,166
He's the groom's childhood friend.

321
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:25,625
Rizwan... Hamza.

322
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,083
Hamza... Rizwan.

323
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,666
He got lucky.

324
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,708
As soon as he arrived, he slipped
straight into Arshad Pappu's gang.

325
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:36,750
Babu Dakait's three boys will try

326
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,125
to attack Naieem
when he leaves the reception.

327
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:42,708
If you manage to save Naieem,
you'll get Rehman's attention right away.

328
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:46,291
The bullet could come
from any direction.

329
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,708
You'll be risking your life.

330
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:50,333
Are you okay with that?

331
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:52,291
Or should we find another way in?

332
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:53,500
No, I'll save the boy.

333
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,708
Don't worry...

334
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:02,916
I'll save him.

335
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,875
Juice?

336
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,958
<i>Rambha ho ho</i>

337
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:33,541
<i>Sambha ho ho</i>

338
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:34,833
Ma'am, juice?

339
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:40,500
I'll get it.

340
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,458
<i>I dance</i>

341
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,333
<i>You dance</i>

342
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:49,416
<i>However much you live with love</i>

343
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:50,666
All good?

344
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,791
Give me orange juice.
That's all everyone wants.

345
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,291
<i>Rambha ho ho</i>

346
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,375
{\an8}<i>Sambha ho ho</i>

347
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,875
That's Naieem.

348
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:20,708
Who's that kid with him?

349
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:27,708
Rehman Baloch's youngest...

350
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,333
Faizal.

351
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:31,875
Do one thing...

352
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,458
You watch Naieem,
I'll handle Faizal.

353
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:44,333
<i>People will come
And go in this world's flow</i>

355
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:56,083
Faizal <i>miyan!</i>
Faizal <i>miyan!</i>

356
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:57,708
Please come here.

357
00:30:58,375 --> 00:30:59,250
<i>Salam.</i>

358
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,166

359

<i>Rambha ho ho</i>

361
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:15,958
- Ma'am, juice?
<i>- Sambha ho ho</i>

362
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:25,875
<i>I dance</i>

363
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:29,625
<i>- You dance</i>
- Where's Faizal?

364
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,875
- Hey!
- You'll certainly compliment me.

365
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:33,916
- Faizal!
- Yeah.

366
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:35,041
It's delicious.

367
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,666
- Let's go.
- What happened? Hey...

368
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:42,000
<i>Sambha ho ho</i>

369
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:04,916
Kill him!

370
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:15,791
Kill him!

371
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,708
Saddam, move!

372
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:42,458

00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,583
<i>You dance</i>

378
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,083
<i>However much you live with love</i>

379
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,125
<i>That much beautiful life will come to be</i>

380
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,250
<i>Rambha ho ho</i>

381
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,750
<i>Sambha ho ho</i>

382
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:15,333
<i>Rambha ho ho</i>

383
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,166
<i>Sambha ho ho</i>

384
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:23,958
<i>People will come</i>

385
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:29,208
- Aalam <i>bhai,</i> come here...
<i>- And go in this world's flow</i>

386
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,333
Hamza, you go,
I'll look after Faizal.

387
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,291
Take care of the kid.

388
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:39,708
<i>We'll join our friends to sing
Dance and glow</i>

389
00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:43,375
<i>Shining stars are shinning</i>

390
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,750
<i>Singing, yeah, yeah, singing</i>

391
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:51,666
<i>For people we love</i>

392
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:54,833
<i>Rambha...</i>

393
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:58,333
<i>Sambha...</i>

00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,625
<i>Ho ho...</i>

395
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,125
<i>Ho ho...</i>

396
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:08,708
<i>Rambha...</i>

397
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:12,291
<i>Sambha...</i>

00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:17,791
<i>Ho ho...</i>

399
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:20,916
<i>Rambha ho ho</i>

400
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,125
He's dead. Get out of here.

401
00:35:11,958 --> 00:35:13,083
Apply pressure to his wound.

402
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:14,875
Apply pressure to his wound now.

403
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:16,666
The kid's been shot.

404
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,125
He's been shot!

405
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,791
Someone call a doctor!
Call an ambulance!

406
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:20,750
Naieem!

407
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,416
Call an ambulance!

408
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:23,916
- Stop the bleeding!
- Naieem!

409
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,875
- Naieem <i>miyan!</i>
- Someone get a car!

410
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,583
Is there a doctor here?

411
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,000
Someone help us!

412
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:33,791
Ambulance!

413
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:15,208
My baby...

414
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:20,500
He shouldn't have gone after a kid!

415
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,208
That rascal!

416
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:24,916
Babu... Babu...

417
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,375
He'll pay for this.

418
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,208
We won't spare him, <i>bhai.</i>

419
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:43,250
Is this my son's blood?

420
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:46,583
- Yes.
- Rehman <i>sahab,</i>

421
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:48,916
he works at my shop.

422
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,291
He's a very hard-working boy.

423
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:54,791
He tried his best to save the kid.

424
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:02,958
How many of them were there?

425
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:05,208
Three.

426
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:09,875
One with a Glock, one with a Uzi,
and one with an AK-47.

427
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,083
The AK didn't have a shoulder stock.

428
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,916
Can you identify them?

429
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,708
Oh Lord, how did this happen?!

430
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:19,041
How could this be allowed to happen?
Dear Lord!

431
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:20,791
What have you done?!

432
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:24,750
I swear on God, the moment
I heard I came over barefoot.

433
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:27,416
Oh Lord, how did this happen?

434
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:28,666
How could this happen?

435
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:31,208
May God grant Naieem paradise.

436
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,750
- Where is he? Take me to him.
- Come with me. This way, please.

437
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,250
Babu Dakait, you scoundrel...
I'm going to bust your balls!

438
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:39,541
Just wait till the elections are over!
I'll make your life a living hell.

439
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:41,958
You know your guns.

440
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:43,750
Yes.

441
00:38:44,916 --> 00:38:46,500
They're common where I come from.

442
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:51,416
And where's that?

443
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:53,291
Kharotabad, Quetta.

444
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,000
- You know your way around a gun?
- Yes.

445
00:38:57,708 --> 00:38:58,583
How?

446
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:01,166
My elder brother was a mujahid
of the Azad Baloch Army.

447
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:03,583
He taught me everything.

448
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:05,333
Where is he now?

449
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:06,666
He was martyred.

450
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:08,625
Any other family?

451
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,083
No.

452
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,125
Where do you stay?

453
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:12,750
At Aalam <i>bhai's</i> shop.

454
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,916
Name?

455
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:15,041
Hamza Ali Mazari.

456
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:18,750
- Donga.
- Yeah, <i>bhai?</i>

457
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:21,250
Give him...

458
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,000
a hundred thousand.

459
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:26,041
He saved Faizal's life.

460
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:29,666
I don't want money.

461
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:32,333
What?

462
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:35,291
What did you say?

463
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,500
I don't want money.

464
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,083
Rehman <i>bhai.</i>

465
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:49,125
Ever since independence,
Pakistan has never given us Baloch

466
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:52,583
our rights or shown us respect.

467
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:56,250
You gave us an identity,

468
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,250
and this is the least I could do,
in return.

469
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:07,375
I don't want money for it.

470
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:21,708
Look after him.

471
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,875
Alright.

472
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,875
And yeah...

473
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:27,000
give him an Alvida.

474
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:18,958
My dear.

475
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:35,125
Uzair, you're my boy.

476
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:36,708
Don't do anything stupid.

477
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:38,041
State elections are
just around the corner.

478
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,583
We're not taking revenge.
Got that?

479
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,416
PAP is counting on Rehman.

480
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,875
Remember 1997?

481
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,041
He caused a scene

482
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,458
and SP Chaudhary had him arrested.

483
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:54,000
I got him out fast, but it still hurt

484
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:57,458
our vote bank, remember?

485
00:41:57,791 --> 00:42:02,208
{\an8}After the elections, once we win,

486
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:04,000
{\an8}not even Babu Dakait,

487
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,125
{\an8}even if he strips and annihilates
Arshad Pappu's family,

488
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,000
nobody will bat an eye.

489
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:10,666
You've got my backing.

490
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:14,416
Not just me, all of Karachi
will be with you.

491
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:16,083
Got it?

492
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:18,291
Uzair...

493
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:19,958
Come here.

494
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,958
Look, keep an eye on your brother.

495
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,583
Don't leave him alone.

496
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:30,041
You have to give me your word.
You'll see me dead otherwise.

497
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,250
Promise me.
Promise me right now.

498
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:32,541
Alright.

499
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:34,041
Good.

500
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:35,375
You're a smart kid.

501
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,208
Goodbye.

502
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:40,291
Let's go.

503
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:56,416
<i>The wind will keep blowing</i>

504
00:42:56,416 --> 00:43:00,791
<i>Whether we are here or not</i>

505
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:07,500
<i>It will live on forever</i>

506
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,958
<i>Whether we are here or not</i>

507
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:18,750
<i>Many warriors have risen to fight</i>

508
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:23,666
<i>Only to have their illusions rot</i>

509
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:30,083
<i>Even the kings were given...</i>

510
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:33,416
Move aside, please.

511
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:34,958
No, not you, sir.

512
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:36,041
It's too crowded here.

513
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:39,875
Zarwari <i>sahab</i> wants a word with you.

514
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:41,208
Here.

515
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,333
<i>Rehman, Naieem's gone.
He's not coming back.</i>

516
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:53,791
<i>We need to start thinking
about what's ahead.</i>

517
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:56,666
<i>Do what Jameel says.</i>

518
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,500
What are you doing?

519
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,166
Stand properly,
stop huddling around me.

520
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:03,250
<i>Bhai's</i> got PAP's full support.

521
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:07,916
We've already swung the local
elections in our favor twice for PAP.

522
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:12,291
On the other hand, there's
the Muslim Movement Party, MMP.

523
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:15,125
They're backing Babu Dakait
and Arshad Pappu.

524
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,083
But it's simple,

525
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:19,750
whoever rules Lyari,

526
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:22,083
rules Karachi.

527
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:27,333
And whoever rules Karachi, rules Pakistan.

528
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,541
I'll see you later. Bye.

529
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:38,708
Our fake weapons beat
Darra Adam Khel's any day.

530
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,000
We run the biggest fake-gun
business in Pakistan.

531
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:44,583
Watch your head.

532
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:48,000
{\an8}Nobody can tell much difference
between ours and the real ones.

533
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:51,041
{\an8}Ours heat up faster,
but they do the job...

534
00:44:51,041 --> 00:44:52,166
{\an8}and that's what matters.

535
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:56,625
After that, everything gets packed
and shipped to Lahore,

536
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:59,541
Azad Kashmir,
even all the way to Africa.

537
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:03,416
Besides that, we're into extortion,
kidnapping, moonshine,

538
00:45:03,416 --> 00:45:06,583
fake-brand cutting, rummy clubs,
political hits, the lot.

539
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:11,458
Millions in Lyari make
a living off what we do.

540
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:13,583
All good? Work going fine?

541
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:16,208
You've already met these boys.

542
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:17,958
Donga will fill you in on the rest.

543
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:20,208
- Uzair <i>bhai, salam.</i>
- Sit, sit... keep working.

544
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:22,000
Look at this.

545
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:23,500
This was made right here too.

546
00:45:24,083 --> 00:45:25,375
One trigger pull gives thirty hits.

547
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:30,541
Come on, Uzair <i>bhai,</i>
a warning would've been nice.

548
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,458
You made me shit my pants.

549
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:34,208
Why are you laughing?

550
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:36,416
Come on, Donga, play with us.

551
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:38,375
Let me teach you.
I taught him as well.

552
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:39,333
What are you looking at?

553
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:40,708
- Come on, Babla. It's your turn.
- That...

554
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:44,333
That's not just a chair,

555
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:47,208
it's a throne.

556
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:52,458
Rehman <i>bhai</i> has carved holes
into countless bodies to earn it.

557
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:02,833
<i>When everyone said that we couldn't
I put in the work just to even the odds</i>

558
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:06,208
<i>The odds against me, demons that
Tempt me, usually come with a smile</i>

559
00:46:06,375 --> 00:46:08,833
<i>And nothing that I wouldn't do for
The people I love, I've been ready to die</i>

560
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,666
And in return, we build schools,

561
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:13,875
colleges, and hospitals for Lyari.

562
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:16,208
<i>Tell me, you ready or not?</i>

563
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,000
<i>You ready or not?</i>

564
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:19,541
<i>You really ready or not?</i>

565
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:20,666
<i>Tell me, you ready or not?</i>

566
00:46:20,666 --> 00:46:22,541
- Come on in.
<i>- Can't tell if you're ready or not</i>

567
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:24,541
- Come inside.
<i>- Are you really ready or not?</i>

568
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:26,166
So, this is the room.

569
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:27,625
That's the kitchen.

570
00:46:27,958 --> 00:46:30,375
Rehman <i>bhai's</i> brother-in-law used
to live here.

571
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:32,875
And this right here is the balcony...

572
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,125
You can see the whole
of Lyari from up here.

573
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,958
Hey, dickhead... Come on,
let's go check out the view from the roof.

574
00:46:37,958 --> 00:46:39,791
<i>I know when I'll find it</i>

575
00:46:39,791 --> 00:46:40,916
<i>To everyone, I make the call</i>

576
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,083
- Come on.
<i>- I'm looking for answers</i>

577
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:44,375
<i>This is the moment, we stand or fall</i>

578
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:46,125
<i>The meaning behind it</i>

579
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:48,708
The Khada Menon Society,

580
00:46:49,125 --> 00:46:50,083
Nawabad,

581
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:51,541
Ragiwara,

582
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,416
Shah Baig Line, Singo Line...

583
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:56,500
Those are some of the turfs controlled
by Arshad Pappu and Babu Dakait.

584
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:58,166
You see that water tank?

585
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,750
Right from there,
the Agra Taj Colony,

586
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:05,208
Allama Iqbal Colony, Baghdadi,
Bihar Colony, Chakiwara...

587
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:07,791
A huge part of Lyari is under
Rehman <i>bhai's</i> control.

588
00:47:08,541 --> 00:47:11,375
{\an8}That's why Babu and Pappu
are eating their hearts out.

589
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,333
Be careful when you go
into the Kalakot area.

590
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,833
That's where SP Aslam
arrested Rehman <i>bhai.</i>

591
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:20,458
Who's SP Aslam?

592
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:23,708
<i>A long time ago,</i>

593
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:28,083
a devil and a jinn had wild sex.

594
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:33,875
Nine months later, the result
was named Chaudhary Aslam.

595
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,166
The only man the entire
Baloch community feared.

596
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:39,041
He was the SP of Lyari once.

597
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:40,375
Now Maqsood's the SP.

598
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:41,833
He's close to us.

599
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,416
If we ever need anything, we can--

600
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:47,125
Seriously, man?
What are you doing?

601
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:49,125
Can't you see I'm just taking a leak?

602
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:50,166
So you're going to piss on the roof?

603
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:53,625
<i>Window dropped low
Rolling up with an axe in hand</i>

604
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:56,916
<i>The enemies are boiling
Their vein swollen and alive</i>

605
00:47:56,916 --> 00:48:00,416
<i>They scowl the moment they
Know their end has arrived</i>

606
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:07,125
<i>It's been a month since
Naieem Baloch was killed,</i>

607
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:09,458
<i>but the police investigation
hasn't moved an inch.</i>

608
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,541
<i>Everyone in Lyari knows the attackers
were from the Pathan Gang,</i>

609
00:48:13,708 --> 00:48:15,458
<i>working under their boss, Babu Dakait.</i>

610
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:18,750
<i>But there's still no sign of any arrests.</i>

611
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:22,833
<i>What's even more shocking is that
Rehman hasn't struck back either.</i>

612
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:25,708
<i>With elections around the corner,</i>

613
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:28,541
<i>has Rehman Dakait chosen
to ignore his own son's murder</i>

614
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:30,541
<i>just to keep his political masters happy?</i>

615
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:33,250
<i>Or has Rehman Dakait lost his power?</i>

616
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:36,333
<i>Stay tuned for more updates from Karachi.</i>

617
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,708
He's got the ball!

618
00:48:40,708 --> 00:48:42,666
- Get past him!
<i>- Yeah, you ready or not?</i>

619
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:45,958
- Yes! Come here, let me give you a kiss!
<i>- Tell me, you ready or not?</i>

620
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:47,583
<i>You really ready or not?</i>

621
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:49,166
- Cover! Cover!
<i>- Tell me, you ready or not?</i>

622
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:50,875
- Cover!
<i>- Can't tell if you're ready or not</i>

623
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,625
- Hey, pass it over!
<i>- Are you really ready or not?</i>

624
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,375
<i>You know if you're ready or not!</i>

625
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,791
- Oh, he's getting away!
- It's okay, it's okay.

626
00:48:57,791 --> 00:48:58,958
- Take this, Hamza!
<i>- Win or lose!</i>

627
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:01,458
<i>- But what is beyond it?</i>
- Hamza, pass the ball!

628
00:49:01,458 --> 00:49:04,416
- Shoot it! Do something!
- Very good! Very good!

629
00:49:04,416 --> 00:49:06,000
- Goal!
<i>- The strike of a Jatt</i>

630
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,125
<i>I'll know when I find it</i>

631
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:14,041
<i>Easy, easy</i>

632
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:16,041
He was on fire today.

633
00:49:16,416 --> 00:49:18,583
Passed the ball like Maradona.

634
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,875
- Donga.
- Yeah?

635
00:49:22,666 --> 00:49:23,541
Here.

636
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:25,125
- I don't smoke.
- Just take a drag!

637
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:27,083
Why do you want a long life?
Take a drag!

638
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:28,625
Go for it.

639
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:29,666
Hamza.

640
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:31,708
Here.

641
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:34,041
Yeah!

642
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,208
Easy, easy.

643
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,416
Are you okay?

644
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,916
This is the place where
I trained Naieem in football.

645
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:01,750
He was just a kid.

646
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:05,083
They shouldn't have killed him.

647
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:09,500
Donga.

648
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:10,958
Yes, <i>bhai?</i>

649
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:13,791
Should we avenge Naieem?

650
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:17,708
We should.

651
00:50:17,958 --> 00:50:18,875
Want me to smack you?

652
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:20,375
He's saying that
because he's scared of you.

653
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:21,333
Tell him the truth.

654
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:25,166
<i>Bhai,</i> we should take revenge,
but not now.

655
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,250
After the election.

656
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:31,291
Babu Dakait is waiting for us to react.

657
00:50:31,708 --> 00:50:33,083
If we do,

658
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,500
we will only lose our boys.

659
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,708
Yes, <i>bhai.</i>

660
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:40,708
We have to win the election.

661
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:44,166
Otherwise, PAP will get pissed at us.

662
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:50,375
And we'll lose the money
we get from them

663
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:52,166
to run the gang, <i>bhai.</i>

664
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,375
You...

665
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,208
If you were in my place,
what would you do?

666
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:07,208
I'd take revenge.

667
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:10,375
- Are you out of your mind, asshole?
- Quiet.

668
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:13,916
Keep talking.

669
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:18,041
You're our leader,
the king of the Baloch.

670
00:51:19,916 --> 00:51:22,458
They slaughtered your son without mercy.

671
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:25,791
If the king doesn't hit back,

672
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:28,333
the whole community gets shamed.

673
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:33,416
And if you're not taking revenge
just to secure an election,

674
00:51:33,416 --> 00:51:35,250
then that election was lost long ago.

675
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:39,916
Till now, to win, you had
to take on Babu Dakait's

676
00:51:39,916 --> 00:51:41,125
and Arshad Pappu's turf.

677
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:44,041
To win outright,

678
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:46,583
you'd have to take all of Lyari.

679
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,041
Babu struck now because he's certain

680
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:57,458
PAP won't let you retaliate
during the elections.

681
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:00,125
The truth is...

682
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:03,291
he won't be ready at all.

683
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:09,291
This is the perfect time to wipe out
his whole crew and take his turf.

684
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:15,041
The people of Lyari decide
who rules Karachi.

685
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:18,666
And it's time the one
who rules Lyari is...

686
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:22,416
the Sher-e-Baloch.

687
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,375
Hamza, I won't do it again.

688
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:44,708
Please, let me go.

689
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:47,416
Come on, man.
Hamza, please...

690
00:52:47,416 --> 00:52:48,750
Let me go, man.

691
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,458
I messed up.

692
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:51,750
I won't do it again.

693
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:53,166
I swear, I won't do it again.

694
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:55,833
Never again, I promise.

695
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:57,666
Please, just let me go.

696
00:52:57,833 --> 00:52:59,000
How much <i>paya</i> did you make today?

697
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:00,291
Five kilos.

698
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:01,416
You're minting money.

699
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:03,541
It's all by God's grace, <i>bhai.</i>

700
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,500
Come quickly.

701
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:23,666
Hurry up.

702
00:53:24,791 --> 00:53:25,708
Yeah.

703
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:35,541
<i>Bhai,</i> from Lane No. 7, he's heading
towards Mehran Khan Road.

704
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:37,416
Please, man, let me go.
I won't do it again.

705
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:40,083
{\an8}I won't do it again.

706
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:41,916
{\an8}Please, man, let me go.

707
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:43,583
Hamza, please.

708
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,250
Please, just let me go.

709
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:48,666
Hamza, please...

710
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:50,041
Maqsood <i>miyan,</i>
Uzair Baloch here.

711
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:53,708
Listen, there's been a cylinder blast
at Hasneinabad Kala Gate.

712
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:56,958
I want the entire Lyari
police force here.

713
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:00,791
And I want every road and street
cleared for the next 40 minutes.

714
00:54:01,416 --> 00:54:02,333
Okay?

715
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:03,458
Goodbye.

716
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,041
- He's running away. Get him.
- Stop, you rascal.

717
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,375
Stop.

718
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:49,125
You can't escape us today.

719
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:00,125
Die, you rascal!

720
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,041
Mom!

721
00:56:11,916 --> 00:56:13,625
- Uzair <i>bhai!</i> Uzair <i>bhai!</i> Babu!
- What?

722
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:15,291
- Babu! Babu!
- Where?

723
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:17,166
Saw him in the lane parallel to us,
inside Imran <i>bhai's</i> rickshaw.

724
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:18,625
Who the hell is Imran now?

725
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,541
Imran Khan!
The Imran Khan!

726
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:22,000
Our captain, Imran!

727
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:24,000
Found Babu!

728
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:26,833
Go, go, go!
Come on, step on it!

729
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:43,833
Over there!

730
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:47,958
O Hussain! O Hussain!

731
00:56:47,958 --> 00:56:50,625
Hamza, turn back, turn back now.
We'll take the other lane. Let's go.

732
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:53,083
O Hussain! O Hussain!

733
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:54,875
O Hussain! O Hussain!

734
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:56,291
{\an8}O Hussain! O Hussain!

735
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,708
Tell <i>bhai</i> to get to Cheel Chowk.

736
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,708
{\an8}Stay back!
I said stay back!

737
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:05,666
{\an8}No one steps in.

738
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:39,791
You're my blood.

739
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:42,625
You're my own son, Rehman.

740
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,375
You want to kill me?

741
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:47,750
Rehman... Rehman,

742
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,166
you are my flesh and blood.

743
00:58:51,166 --> 00:58:52,833
You killed your mother,

744
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:55,666
and now you're going to kill me too?

745
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:59,291
You're my son, Rehman.

746
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:01,000
I'm your father.

747
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:03,708
You're my boy...

748
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:05,750
I'm your father...

749
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:06,750
Rehman...

750
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:10,500
Rehman, you... Rehman...

751
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:13,583
You never should've
killed my son, Babu.

752
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:14,666
Rehman...

753
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,125
From this moment on,

754
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:38,375
the Baloch rule Lyari.

755
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,291
And whoever betrays us

756
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:45,000
will suffer the same fate.

757
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,541
{\an8}<i>PAP, PAP, PAP!</i>

758
01:00:01,541 --> 01:00:02,666
{\an8}<i>PAP!</i>

759
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:06,166
{\an8}<i>PAP, PAP, PAP!</i>

760
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:10,166
Such a victory has never before
been seen in the history of Lyari.

761
01:00:10,583 --> 01:00:13,458
Mr. Jameel Jamali,
who has won with 300,000 votes,

762
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:15,708
{\an8}believes Karachi is only the beginning.

763
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:18,041
When the party president,
the daughter of the nation,

764
01:00:18,041 --> 01:00:20,416
Ms. Benazir Bhutto,
returns from London,

765
01:00:20,666 --> 01:00:23,625
all of Pakistan will be under PAP's reign.

766
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:24,875
- The future of Pakistan...
- Jameel Jamali!

767
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:27,166
My dear brothers and sisters,

768
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,750
{\an8}today, I see a spark in your eyes.

769
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:33,041
When I look at you,

770
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:38,458
that spark tells me
that our Lyari demands change.

771
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:43,500
{\an8}And that same spark is screaming
and telling me

772
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:47,125
we need a big shift in our lives now.

773
01:00:47,125 --> 01:00:50,458
And that change should come
and will come.

774
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:53,041
And by the grace of Allah--

775
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,291
Rehman Baloch!

776
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:17,000
{\an8}Rehman Baloch! Rehman Baloch!

777
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:19,916
<i>All my enemies standing in front of me</i>

778
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:22,166
<i>Vengeance got no remedy</i>

779
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:24,375
<i>All my enemies standing in front of me</i>

780
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,708
<i>Vengeance got no remedy</i>

781
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:29,083
<i>All my enemies standing in front of me</i>

782
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:31,291
<i>Vengeance got no remedy</i>

783
01:01:31,291 --> 01:01:33,666
<i>All my enemies standing in front of me</i>

784
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,791
<i>Vengeance got no remedy</i>

785
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:38,666
{\an8}<i>Panic
When I walk in they go panic</i>

786
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,166
<i>There's too much blood
They need a bandage</i>

787
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:43,250
<i>There ain't nobody left standing</i>

788
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:45,791
<i>When I take shots, they can't manage</i>

789
01:01:45,791 --> 01:01:47,833
<i>The mastermind when I plan it</i>

790
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:50,208
<i>Aim for your head, then I'm banging</i>

791
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:52,583
{\an8}<i>When I walk in, they get panic</i>

792
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:54,875
<i>'Cause I'm that number one gangster</i>

793
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:57,416
<i>Gunshot to your head...</i>

794
01:01:57,416 --> 01:01:59,958
It's being said that the credit
for this victory goes to

795
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,041
Mr. Rehman Baloch,
a.k.a. Rehman Dakait.

796
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:04,500
The way he managed
to draw not only the Baloch votes

797
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,916
but also those of the Pathans, Muhajirs,

798
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:08,791
and other communities
toward him is remarkable.

799
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:12,208
<i>Chop off your head, that's my passion</i>

800
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:14,583
<i>Dissolve your body in acid</i>

801
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,791
<i>'Cause I'm that number one gangster</i>

802
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:17,833
<i>Panic</i>

803
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:32,000
Rehman! Rehman! Rehman!

804
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:50,416
<i>You're a moon with a heartbeat</i>

805
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:59,291
<i>Stealing glances meant only for me</i>

806
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:04,666
<i>You're the road to my heaven, you know</i>

807
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:27,375
Your father won the election

808
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,791
and you're sitting here,
looking grumpy.

809
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:31,416
So what do you expect me to do,
start dancing?

810
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:34,875
Have some shame.

811
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:36,041
- Get up and come with me.
- Mom...

812
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,416
My father won the election,

813
01:03:37,416 --> 01:03:38,833
why do I have to parade around for it?

814
01:03:39,375 --> 01:03:41,375
I'm already late for my medical class.
I'm leaving.

815
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:42,333
Quiet.

816
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:46,166
Let go of those dreams
about studying medicine

817
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:48,208
- in Islamabad now.
- Mom...

818
01:03:48,416 --> 01:03:50,833
We'll find a nice boy
and get you married.

819
01:03:51,333 --> 01:03:54,750
Your father's teamed up
with goons and thugs,

820
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:56,875
and you're making
my life miserable on top of that.

821
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:57,916
- Come with me! Let's go.
- What are you doing, Mom?

822
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:00,375
Mr. Jameel wants you on stage
for a photo op.

823
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:02,208
- Let's go.
- No, just you.

824
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:29,041
Rehman Baloch! Rehman Baloch!
Rehman Baloch!

825
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:30,208
Uzair <i>miyan...</i>

826
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:32,916
Javed <i>bhai!
As-salam alaykum.</i> All good?

827
01:04:32,916 --> 01:04:34,416
<i>Wa'alaykumu s-salam.</i>

828
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,458
<i>- Wa'alaykumu s-salam,</i> Altaf <i>bhai.</i>
- How are you?

829
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:38,250
- How do I look?
- First class.

830
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,916
How are you, our savior?

831
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:42,583
Rehman Baloch! Rehman Baloch!

832
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:43,833
What's going on?

833
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:46,958
<i>Bhai,</i> this is Javed Khanani
and Altaf Khanani.

834
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:50,041
They covered all the expenses
for PAP's elections.

835
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:53,125
This is my brother, Rehman Baloch.

836
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:55,541
{\an8}<i>-As-salam alaykum.
- As-salam alaykum.</i>

837
01:04:56,875 --> 01:04:58,500
{\an8}I've heard a lot about you.
Nice to finally meet you.

838
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:03,000
Zarwari <i>sahab's</i> party believes that
if you stand with them,

839
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,541
PAP will sweep the national elections too.

840
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:08,208
If God wills.

841
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:13,625
There's a lot we can do
for each other.

842
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:18,875
Lyari is perfect for our business.

843
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,166
If someone generous like you is
in charge there,

844
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,416
we can run our business without any fear.

845
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:26,458
Ever thought about joining politics?

846
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:30,958
Look around you, sir.

847
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:33,708
Look how people react to you.
It's unreal how--

848
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:35,208
Why are you all standing here
roasting in the sun?

849
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:38,333
You know Babu Dakait got paralyzed
because of heatstroke, right?

850
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:41,458
- Come on, let's sit in my AC cabin.
- That's kind of you, sir,

851
01:05:41,791 --> 01:05:42,916
but I should get going now.

852
01:05:42,916 --> 01:05:44,125
- You sure?
- Yes, yes.

853
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:45,208
- Alright, then.
- Okay.

854
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:47,833
- Rehman <i>miyan,</i> all good?
- Let's go, Altaf.

855
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:48,875
- Goodbye.
- Uzair...

856
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:50,166
I need to discuss something
important with you.

857
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:51,125
Yes, tell me.

858
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:54,583
I'm thinking...

859
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:57,708
instead of doing all this,

860
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,291
I should form a party
and enter politics myself.

861
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:04,291
What do you think?

862
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:07,708
Did that scare you?

863
01:06:09,375 --> 01:06:11,500
I'll be part of your party.

864
01:06:12,541 --> 01:06:15,791
But with a separate identity.

865
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:19,708
That way, I can cut into the
Muslim Movement Party's votes

866
01:06:20,625 --> 01:06:21,625
and move them to you.

867
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:27,041
My boy's getting sharp now...

868
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:29,708
Come on, I'll get you a cold drink.

869
01:06:29,875 --> 01:06:31,250
- Listen...
- Yes?

870
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,250
Listen!

871
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,291
- What are you saying?
- Come on.

872
01:06:35,666 --> 01:06:36,583
I'll be right back.

873
01:06:41,125 --> 01:06:42,000
What?

874
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,791
- Is that how you talk to your mother?
- What?

875
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,708
- What? How is this my fault?
- Is that the tone you use with her?

876
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:46,916
- She snatched my phone!
- That phone is the root of all evil.

877
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:48,375
Give me the phone.
You're glued to it all day.

878
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:49,958
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Shameless kid.

879
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:52,291
- What are you waiting for? Get in.
- This isn't fair! First, you scold me

880
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:54,000
- and then you throw my phone!
- Get in the car right now.

881
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,125
Stop talking nonsense!

882
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,500
Tell me how is this my fault!

883
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,708
- You always blame me for everything!
- Shut up.

884
01:07:19,833 --> 01:07:21,333
Hey, whose phone did you flick?

885
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:24,458
Someone's looking all red today.

886
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,041
It's not red, it's meroon.

887
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:29,916
It's not meroon, it's maroon, dickhead!

888
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:31,250
What?

889
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:36,458
How much do these Khanani brothers
make in a month?

890
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,250
<i>Bhai,</i> roughly speaking,

891
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:42,958
they pull in around 15
to 20 million just through forex.

892
01:07:43,583 --> 01:07:47,250
Another 20-25 million through <i>hawala,</i>

893
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:50,833
and around 30 million
from fake stamp papers.

894
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,916
I've heard rumors that they recently got
their hands on plates

895
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:56,000
to print Indian 500
and 1000-rupee notes.

896
01:07:57,791 --> 01:07:59,000
If that's true,

897
01:07:59,916 --> 01:08:04,875
they'll be making at least five
to six hundred million a month.

898
01:08:05,583 --> 01:08:07,708
- Hamza, get me some ice.
- Yes.

899
01:08:10,875 --> 01:08:12,791
But how do they get
that fake money into India?

900
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:15,083
You need a serious network for that.

901
01:08:15,083 --> 01:08:16,541
It's simple.

902
01:08:17,708 --> 01:08:19,833
From Karachi by sea to Qatar,

903
01:08:20,708 --> 01:08:22,916
then from Qatar it goes
in plane cargo to Nepal.

904
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,291
There's an Airport Minister in Nepal

905
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:28,208
whose son moves everything
across the border

906
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:30,375
and sends it to a slaughterhouse
in Uttar Pradesh.

907
01:08:30,625 --> 01:08:33,166
Slaughterhouses always deal in cash.

908
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:38,250
So they mix the fake notes
in with that cash.

909
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,166
What?

910
01:08:45,208 --> 01:08:46,083
What?

911
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:48,208
Speak freely.

912
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:56,125
<i>Bhai...</i> I was thinking,

913
01:08:56,750 --> 01:09:00,750
if you want to rise in politics,
you need rich friends.

914
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:03,625
Violence can only take you
as far as Lyari's throne.

915
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,041
To reach greater heights,

916
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,833
you must let your talent shine
in the world of the wealthy.

917
01:09:36,541 --> 01:09:37,458
Enjoy.

918
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:22,083
<i>Deaf-to-the-world

01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:25,583

Gonna burn if we slow down</i>

SP Maqsood, how are you?
All well?

947
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:14,666
Some "burger" kids are having
a wild party at Qasim Qila.

948
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:17,541
Hit them with a raid,
and you'll make millions.

949
01:12:18,083 --> 01:12:19,166
Life will get nice and smooth.

950
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:21,166

Wanna breathe, wanna live it</i>

959
01:13:02,791 --> 01:13:06,083
<i>Your lips made a thousand
Promises each time they spoke</i>

960

Your love is a blessing?</i>

961
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,166
<i>I just wanna feel

966
01:13:22,416 --> 01:13:24,375
<i>- Oh, yeah

967
01:13:28,416 --> 01:13:34,583

968
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:42,041

971
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:47,541
<i>You ain't never met a bad girl like me</i>

972
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:49,333
<i>Living it up, hand on a gun so pretty</i>

973
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:51,083
<i>Could you fall in love
With a girl like me?</i>

974
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:52,958
<i>My baby tough, he got a red machete</i>

975
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:54,666
<i>You ain't never met a bad girl like me</i>

976
01:13:54,666 --> 01:13:56,750

01:13:57,250 --> 01:14:00,208
<i>Oh God, oh God
Oh God, when it all goes down</i>

978
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:03,750
<i>I'm gone, oh God
Oh God, can you hold me down?</i>

979
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:07,791
<i>Still got my love to take
Don't give if you want it all</i>

980
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:11,291
<i>Oh God, oh God
Oh God, can you hold me down?</i>

981
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:16,375
<i>Oh, my love, please come here</i>

982
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:18,666
<i>He's so gangster, run down the city</i>

983
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:23,375
<i>Quench my restless soul that
Glows and flickers like embers</i>

984
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:25,833
{\an8}<i>Cold romance, yeah, he's my Da Vinci</i>

985
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:31,333
<i>Come hold me tight
And quiet all the tremors</i>

986
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:33,041
<i>He's so candid, I'm his devotee</i>

987
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:34,833
<i>Come, hold me tight</i>

988
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:36,583
<i>He's so gangster, run down the city</i>

989
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:38,583
<i>Come, hold me tight</i>

990
01:14:45,291 --> 01:14:47,250
I'm sorry, but looks like
we just ran out of fuel.

991
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:51,791
Come on, I'll walk you home.

992
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:53,833
No need, I live close by.

993
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:55,208
I can manage on my own.
Thank you.

994
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:56,791
The thing is,

995
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:00,000
My mother used to say...

996
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:03,875
that men who protect
women earn their place in heaven.

997
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:07,166
So please, don't take my seat
in heaven away from me.

998
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:12,333
Yalina.

999
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:13,375
Hamza.

1000
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:16,125
I saw you at the rally the other day.

1001
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:18,208
Are you also into politics with my dad?

1002
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,708
The truth would be too bitter for you...

1003
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,458
and I don't have the courage to lie today.

1004
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:26,958
You've already shown enough courage today.

1005
01:15:27,708 --> 01:15:28,916
I won't test you more.

1006
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:32,833
You can tell me your bitter truth.

1007
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:41,708
My full name is Hamza Ali Mazari.

1008
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:45,083
I work for Rehman Baloch's gang.

1009
01:15:47,041 --> 01:15:49,208
I'm involved in all his
illegal businesses.

1010
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:53,833
But I also love poetry.

1011
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:57,708
Mir, Faiz, Iqbal, Ghalib...

1012
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:00,291
I don't do drugs or drink.

1013
01:16:00,458 --> 01:16:01,750
I have a cigarette or two sometimes.

1014
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,666
I've never misbehaved with a girl.

1015
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:08,708
I got into this line
because I was broke.

1016
01:16:15,541 --> 01:16:16,458
I'm poor,

1017
01:16:17,666 --> 01:16:18,666
but I'm not a failure.

1018
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:23,583
Want more bitter truth,
or is that enough for today?

1019
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:32,208
I have something that belongs to you.

1020
01:18:02,291 --> 01:18:03,291
How did Pakistan get hold of

1021
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:06,125
our printing plates for the 500
and 1000-rupee notes?

1022
01:18:06,416 --> 01:18:09,625
Looks like some high-level ministry
bureaucrats were involved, sir.

1023
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:13,541
Sir, recently, a huge amount
of fake currency

1024
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:15,666
has entered UP through Nepal
and Bangladesh.

1025
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,583
We know the culprit, sir,
but UP's mafia network is so strong

1026
01:18:19,583 --> 01:18:21,333
that breaking into it has
become nearly impossible.

1027
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:24,375
TRUTH ALONE TRIUMPHS

1028
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:26,583
We've managed to infiltrate
the Karachi mafia,

1029
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:28,875
but we can't even get close
to the UP Mafia!

1030
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,416
Ridiculous.

1031
01:18:30,916 --> 01:18:33,166
Sir, these criminals have such
heavy political backing

1032
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:34,791
that arresting them is impossible.

1033
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:37,750
Even if we gather enough evidence
and pick them up,

1034
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:39,500
they've always got the option
of communal riots.

1035
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,625
Their people will set UP
on fire in two hours.

1036
01:18:42,291 --> 01:18:44,083
We need a government
that will back us strongly.

1037
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:45,916
Do one thing...

1038
01:18:46,291 --> 01:18:48,083
Let's at least start gathering intel.

1039
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:51,791
If someday a leader comes
to power in UP

1040
01:18:51,791 --> 01:18:53,708
who actually cares about the country,

1041
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:56,208
this evidence will be useful.

1042
01:18:57,833 --> 01:18:58,708
Yes, sir.

1043
01:19:00,166 --> 01:19:01,083
And Bansal,

1044
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:04,875
find out which ministry official
helped them.

1045
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:11,208
Indians are India's own
biggest enemies.

1046
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:14,916
Pakistan comes second.

1047
01:19:33,958 --> 01:19:36,541
- Come along.
- Rehman <i>bhai,</i> welcome.

1048
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:38,000
Uzair <i>miyan.</i>

1049
01:19:38,166 --> 01:19:39,708
- Javed <i>bhai,</i> all good?
- All good.

1050
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,166
This way, please.

1051
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:43,583
<i>Salam alaykum.</i>

1052
01:20:25,291 --> 01:20:27,958
Major Iqbal is on his way here
following a meeting with Zarwari <i>sahab.</i>

1053
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,333
Welcome,
Rehman <i>bhai.</i>

1054
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:33,250
Meet Sajid Mir from Lashkar.

1055
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:36,083
Abdul Bhuttovi
and Azam Cheema.

1056
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:37,375
Sir.

1057
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:39,875
They run the biggest mujahid
training camps in Muridke.

1058
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:41,291
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1059
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:45,666
And this is Dawood Sayed Gilani,
a.k.a. David Headley.

1060
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:47,625
He works with Major Iqbal.

1061
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:52,666
And this here is Rehman Baloch,

1062
01:20:53,166 --> 01:20:54,541
Lyari's undisputed king.

1063
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:57,791
All he needs is a political crown.

1064
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:14,583
{\an8}Then I promise that you'll
win Lyari's next election.

1065
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:17,541
{\an8}And this is Major Iqbal from ISI.

1066
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:18,583
{\an8}Rehman <i>bhai.</i>

1067
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:21,250
Nothing moves in the
Pakistani government

1068
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:22,625
without his consent.

1069
01:21:22,875 --> 01:21:25,791
This massive business that we've built
is only because of his blessing.

1070
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:28,041
Javed <i>bhai,</i>
blessings come from Allah.

1071
01:21:28,208 --> 01:21:30,791
I only carry out His will.

1072
01:21:31,166 --> 01:21:32,041
Come on...

1073
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:33,875
Let's talk shop.

1074
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:35,125
Sit.

1075
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:50,458
Rehman <i>bhai...</i>

1076
01:21:57,625 --> 01:22:00,541
We need arms and ammunition
from you in bulk.

1077
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:02,541
Not the fake stuff,

1078
01:22:02,916 --> 01:22:03,916
the real deal.

1079
01:22:04,583 --> 01:22:09,791
Guns stamped "Made in Russia"
or "Made in America", not ours.

1080
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:13,333
If an international investigation
happens tomorrow,

1081
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:15,833
ISI's name shouldn't show up anywhere.

1082
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:17,833
All we've got are first copies.

1083
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:19,791
Replica guns.

1084
01:22:23,125 --> 01:22:25,375
You hold real influence in Balochistan.

1085
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:28,875
Baloch United Force and its nine

1086
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:33,458
leaders call you the Sher-e-Baloch.

1087
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:37,083
They see you as their savior.

1088
01:22:37,875 --> 01:22:42,000
They'll never refuse you.

1089
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:47,583
That's why you should buy
the weapons from them.

1090
01:22:48,166 --> 01:22:50,333
I'll pay you far above market price.

1091
01:22:50,958 --> 01:22:52,500
You could've done that yourself.

1092
01:22:59,416 --> 01:23:01,791
The Baloch are fighting
with us for independence.

1093
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:04,375
Why would they give us their guns?

1094
01:23:07,083 --> 01:23:08,833
They'd never hand anything to Major <i>sahab.</i>

1095
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:13,791
ISI and the Rangers have wiped
out many BUF rebels lately.

1096
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:17,875
And also killed 70 of their relatives
under the pretense of "interrogations."

1097
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,666
I won't betray my community.

1098
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:36,125
Fine.

1099
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,375
But Rehman <i>bhai,</i> anyone who's climbed
to the top of Pakistani politics has had

1100
01:23:43,541 --> 01:23:47,458
to get their hands dirty to reach there.

1101
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:52,583
If you want to step into this hammam,

1102
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:55,583
you have to get naked.

1103
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:01,916
I'm sorry,

1104
01:24:01,916 --> 01:24:05,333
but without knowing where
those guns will be used,

1105
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,708
it's tough for us to seal this deal.

1106
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:10,625
You give us weapons,

1107
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:12,916
we give you money.

1108
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:16,750
You don't need to know
anything beyond that.

1109
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:19,083
Bhuttovi <i>sahab,</i>

1110
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:21,541
every business survives on trust.

1111
01:24:23,166 --> 01:24:24,916
Doesn't hurt to offer
them some reassurance.

1112
01:24:31,291 --> 01:24:33,416
Next month, first Friday, 3rd October,

1113
01:24:34,041 --> 01:24:35,500
{\an8}about a dozen mujahids are going to India.

1114
01:24:36,625 --> 01:24:38,750
{\an8}This time we've planned something big.

1115
01:24:39,083 --> 01:24:40,833
They'll be leaving from Karachi.

1116
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:45,333
So we need the entire shipment
safely delivered by Thursday.

1117
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,416
Rehman <i>bhai,</i> don't worry.

1118
01:24:50,666 --> 01:24:52,541
This is not just about money,

1119
01:24:52,958 --> 01:24:56,000
I'll personally speak
to Zarwari <i>sahab</i> about you.

1120
01:24:58,083 --> 01:24:59,041
That's great.

1121
01:24:59,625 --> 01:25:00,833
Congratulations on the election win.

1122
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:05,541
I guarantee that Zarwari <i>sahab</i>
will never say no to him.

1123
01:25:14,833 --> 01:25:15,750
Alright, then,

1124
01:25:16,666 --> 01:25:20,166
you'll get everything by
Thursday next month.

1125
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:23,750
Payment will be in dollars.

1126
01:25:26,416 --> 01:25:27,833
And don't make the mistake of

1127
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,083
forgetting the promise you made.

1128
01:25:34,666 --> 01:25:35,958
I'm sure you know...

1129
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:41,708
death by the hands of Rehman Dakait

1130
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:46,291
is unimaginably barbaric.

1131
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,458
Goodbye.

1132
01:26:14,166 --> 01:26:15,291
Yes, Javed, what is it?

1133
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:16,583
<i>He came here.</i>

1134
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:19,208
He wants to take Lyari from you.

1135
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:24,208
If Rehman spreads his wings,
you'll lose your post and your honor.

1136
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,666
To kill a devil...

1137
01:26:30,916 --> 01:26:32,791
I'll have to rub the lamp.

1138
01:26:35,208 --> 01:26:38,666
Looks like it's time
to unleash the jinn.

1139
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,875
<i>Wind, O wind</i>

1140
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:34,416
<i>Carry her fragrance through the air</i>

1141
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:35,666
<i>And tell me</i>

1142
01:27:35,666 --> 01:27:38,208
<i>- Where her hair first fell loose</i>
- Who is he?

1143
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:40,041
<i>Give me a sign of where she is</i>

1144
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:42,041
<i>Please let me know</i>

1145
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:43,958
<i>I'll go to her</i>

1146
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:46,041
<i>Just let me see her once</i>

1147
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,875
<i>Lead me to the one I love</i>

1148
01:27:47,875 --> 01:27:50,000
<i>Lead him to his beloved</i>

1149
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,625
<i>Lead me to the one I love</i>

1150
01:27:51,625 --> 01:27:53,916
<i>Lead him to his beloved</i>

1151
01:28:05,708 --> 01:28:06,625
Where's Mufeed?

1152
01:28:07,375 --> 01:28:08,375
He's gone for Hajj.

1153
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:10,291
<i>Bade sahab</i> sent me instead.

1154
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:12,916
Cash?

1155
01:28:28,083 --> 01:28:29,041
Where are you from?

1156
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:30,791
Nushki.

1157
01:28:31,291 --> 01:28:32,291
Oh, nice...

1158
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:33,708
Balochistan?

1159
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:34,916
- Yeah.
- All three of you?

1160
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:38,416
Then you're a brother to me.

1161
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:41,166
Come, let me treat you
to some top-class hash.

1162
01:28:54,833 --> 01:28:56,333
Mufeed!

1163
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:57,666
Mufeed!

1164
01:29:21,791 --> 01:29:23,583
Hang in there,
I'll come back for you.

1165
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:28,208
Hey, asshole,

1166
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:30,958
this is an M4.
You really think you can outrun it?

1167
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:35,666
<i>Once again, someone's face lit up</i>

1168
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:39,458
<i>Today, they found the one they had lost</i>

1169
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:43,166
<i>How did they find them, and where--</i>

1170
01:30:01,708 --> 01:30:02,666
What were you thinking?

1171
01:30:03,125 --> 01:30:04,666
<i>Bade sahab</i> is some idiot?

1172
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:09,000
You really thought you'd team
up with Mufeed,

1173
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,125
steal a grain's worth of stuff,

1174
01:30:12,958 --> 01:30:14,458
and walk out unscathed?

1175
01:30:19,125 --> 01:30:22,583
Cocaine has no smell, idiot.

1176
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:27,750
Who puts talcum powder
in a heroin packet, dimwit?

1177
01:30:28,791 --> 01:30:30,208
You would've gotten away with it

1178
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:33,041
even if you'd used crushed
headache pills.

1179
01:30:40,666 --> 01:30:43,166
Back when I was in the police,
I had a partner.

1180
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:48,750
I loved him more than
I'd love my own brother.

1181
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:54,041
Then I found out that behind
my back, he and my fiancée were...

1182
01:30:56,791 --> 01:30:57,666
Then what?

1183
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:00,666
During one of our operations,

1184
01:31:00,666 --> 01:31:02,500
I turned my gun on him and fired.

1185
01:31:04,666 --> 01:31:08,291
Ripped his guts out and hung them
on my two-timing fiancée's doorknob.

1186
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:15,791
I always tell <i>Bade sahab,</i>

1187
01:31:16,708 --> 01:31:18,541
I'd trust a crocodile,

1188
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:21,791
but never someone like them!

1189
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:26,583
No!

1190
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,916
<i>Once again, someone's face lit up</i>

1191
01:31:40,916 --> 01:31:42,708
SWINE JAMALI

1192
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:45,541
<i>- Today, they found the one they had lost
- Hey, SP...</i>

1193
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:46,583
Jameel <i>sahab,</i>

1194
01:31:47,333 --> 01:31:48,916
I just ran into three pigs.

1195
01:31:49,666 --> 01:31:51,541
I was hoping to spot a fourth,

1196
01:31:51,916 --> 01:31:53,250
and then you called.

1197
01:31:54,416 --> 01:31:56,125
Tell me, what can I do for you?

1198
01:31:56,125 --> 01:31:58,041
<i>Forget the pigs
and tell me where you are!</i>

1199
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:03,875
{\an8}Careful.

1200
01:32:08,916 --> 01:32:10,458
Careful.
Come with me.

1201
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:11,833
This isn't right, Rehman <i>bhai.</i>

1202
01:32:16,458 --> 01:32:17,833
You're turning your back
on your own people.

1203
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:21,958
Do you even know

1204
01:32:22,958 --> 01:32:24,291
who you're siding with?

1205
01:32:25,208 --> 01:32:27,416
The same men our brothers are
fighting with for freedom every day,

1206
01:32:27,416 --> 01:32:28,625
Those who are killing them every day?

1207
01:32:30,125 --> 01:32:32,083
Our children are being butchered,
our women violated...

1208
01:32:32,083 --> 01:32:33,500
They want to wipe out
our whole community

1209
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,666
and you're helping them?

1210
01:32:44,291 --> 01:32:46,375
Don't start that community
lecture with me, asshole.

1211
01:32:49,083 --> 01:32:52,083
I've taken four bullets
for my community.

1212
01:32:54,125 --> 01:32:56,583
My community cost me my son.

1213
01:32:58,583 --> 01:33:00,583
If I take some back now,

1214
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:06,916
I'm not robbing you of your mother,
you little shit.

1215
01:33:09,708 --> 01:33:10,583
<i>Bhai...</i>

1216
01:33:10,875 --> 01:33:12,333
You're going to preach to me about right
and wrong, your dickless clown?

1217
01:33:12,833 --> 01:33:13,708
No, <i>bhai...</i>

1218
01:33:13,708 --> 01:33:17,041
<i>- Bhai,</i> come inside, he's just a kid.
- You'll preach to me?

1219
01:33:17,041 --> 01:33:19,458
Let it go, <i>bhai,</i> he's just a kid.

1220
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:21,291
Hamza, leave.

1221
01:33:21,458 --> 01:33:22,375
You've lost your mind or what?

1222
01:33:22,708 --> 01:33:23,708
Cut this nonsense!

1223
01:33:24,625 --> 01:33:27,291
Hamza, leave, get out.

1224
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,416
<i>Bhai,</i> let's go inside.

1225
01:33:28,583 --> 01:33:29,958
Hamza, I said go home!

1226
01:33:30,708 --> 01:33:31,666
Bloody dimwit.

1227
01:33:35,291 --> 01:33:37,333
3rd October, 12 mujahids.

1228
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,833
But why Karachi?

1229
01:33:41,333 --> 01:33:42,583
It's not close to any border,

1230
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:44,166
and they have no way
to fly out from there.

1231
01:33:47,666 --> 01:33:49,625
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.

1232
01:33:51,833 --> 01:33:53,000
They might be going by sea.

1233
01:33:55,458 --> 01:33:56,333
Gujarat.

1234
01:33:58,125 --> 01:33:59,333
Their target has to be Gujarat.

1235
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:08,833
Okay.

1236
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:13,208
Are you sure?

1237
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:15,833
Fine. Okay.

1238
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:19,166
I just got an alert from Victor One.

1239
01:34:20,541 --> 01:34:21,708
You got it too?

1240
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:24,291
I've received the same
warning three times,

1241
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:26,500
3rd October, Karachi Port.

1242
01:34:26,875 --> 01:34:27,875
I got one from Tango Nine too,

1243
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:30,166
but its location is Porbandar.

1244
01:34:30,583 --> 01:34:32,541
Same intel, ten to twelve heavily
armed terrorists.

1245
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:33,541
- Porbandar?
- Yeah.

1246
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:34,625
Guys, I got the same warning as well.

1247
01:34:35,166 --> 01:34:36,500
Mine said Jamnagar,

1248
01:34:37,208 --> 01:34:38,291
but the description
was exactly the same.

1249
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:40,291
We can't track this many
locations at once,

1250
01:34:40,291 --> 01:34:41,375
it's not humanly possible.

1251
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,291
Should we loop in Bansal sir?

1252
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,333
Let's alert Naval Intelligence
and Gujarat ATS.

1253
01:34:48,708 --> 01:34:49,708
They'll handle it from there.

1254
01:34:52,125 --> 01:34:53,000
Okay.

1255
01:35:20,083 --> 01:35:21,333
<i>Yes, by God</i>

1256
01:35:21,333 --> 01:35:23,458
<i>Bro, go for it
I've got a great vibe going</i>

1257
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:26,041
<i>Bro, you'll win
This dance is amazing</i>

1258
01:35:26,041 --> 01:35:28,416
<i>Bro, go for it
I've got a great vibe going</i>

1259
01:35:28,416 --> 01:35:30,416
<i>Bro, you'll win
This dance is amazing</i>

1260
01:35:30,416 --> 01:35:32,833
<i>I've got a strong dance move for you
My friend</i>

1261
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,166
<i>It's called Sabouha
Destiny itself proposed to her</i>

1262
01:35:35,166 --> 01:35:37,791
<i>Stretch your hand next to you
And give it a slap</i>

1263
01:35:37,791 --> 01:35:39,833
<i>Shake your shoulder
This way and stay sturdy</i>

1264
01:35:39,833 --> 01:35:41,541
<i>Give me the prey dance</i>

1265
01:35:41,666 --> 01:35:43,916
<i>Add some more, I've got the money</i>

1266
01:35:43,916 --> 01:35:46,208
<i>For the pro, that we know is a catch</i>

1267
01:35:46,375 --> 01:35:48,666
<i>The one acting all high and mighty</i>

1268
01:35:48,666 --> 01:35:50,416
<i>Okay, then, do a dance for me</i>

1269
01:35:50,416 --> 01:35:52,750
<i>Come on, bring me a karak tea</i>

1270
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:54,541
<i>Hey, get the car, let's go!</i>

1271
01:35:54,541 --> 01:35:56,458
<i>Do another dance for me</i>

1272
01:35:56,458 --> 01:35:58,958
<i>The penguin dance
Or the six-eight rhythm dance</i>

1273
01:35:58,958 --> 01:36:01,000
<i>Bro, go for it
I've got a great vibe going</i>

1274
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,333
<i>Bro, you'll win, this dance is amazing</i>

1275
01:36:03,333 --> 01:36:05,750
<i>Bro, go for it
I've got a great vibe going</i>

1276
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:08,250
<i>Bro, you'll win, this dance is amazing</i>

1277
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:10,750
<i>Nice, nice, his spot is nice</i>

1278
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:13,083
<i>His decoration is nice</i>

1279
01:36:13,083 --> 01:36:15,333
<i>Do the marshmallow dance for me</i>

1280
01:36:15,333 --> 01:36:17,791
<i>Our Lord's made everything perfect</i>

1281
01:36:17,791 --> 01:36:19,666
<i>Your friend's shoulder is dropping
He's shaking it too much</i>

1282
01:36:21,916 --> 01:36:24,291
<i>Hey, look, Aboudi is calling out!</i>

1283
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:26,625
<i>As we carry the night, come on, let's go</i>

1284
01:36:26,916 --> 01:36:29,166
<i>I'm telling you
Dance for me, it makes me happy!</i>

1285
01:36:29,166 --> 01:36:31,583
<i>Give me a dance, eat snacks</i>

1286
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:34,166
<i>I'm telling you
Do a hello goodbye dance</i>

1287
01:36:34,166 --> 01:36:36,291
<i>Add lots of sugar while I drink my tea</i>

1288
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,625
<i>Bro, go for it
I've got a great vibe going</i>

1289
01:36:38,625 --> 01:36:41,000
<i>Bro, you'll win
This dance is amazing</i>

1290
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,333
<i>Bro, go for it
I've got a great vibe going</i>

1291
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:45,708
<i>Bro, you'll win
This dance is amazing</i>

1292
01:36:45,708 --> 01:36:48,125
<i>Bro, go for it
I've got a great vibe going</i>

1293
01:36:48,125 --> 01:36:50,416
<i>Bro, you'll win
This dance is amazing</i>

1294
01:36:50,416 --> 01:36:52,750
<i>Bro, go for it
I've got a great vibe going</i>

1295
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:55,333
<i>Bro, you'll win
This dance is amazing</i>

1296
01:36:58,291 --> 01:36:59,583
Two, three...

1297
01:37:00,041 --> 01:37:01,000
Count as you keep them.

1298
01:37:03,125 --> 01:37:04,583
- Shirani <i>sahab...</i>
- Yes?

1299
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:08,541
<i>Bhai</i> has set up medical coaching
in Karachi for Shahbaz

1300
01:37:08,958 --> 01:37:10,000
and a hundred other children.

1301
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:12,791
We'll take care of their food,
stay, everything.

1302
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:15,666
You just tell us
when they'll be ready to leave.

1303
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:17,166
We'll handle the rest.

1304
01:37:20,166 --> 01:37:21,916
Your grandfather has a lot
of hopes from you, son.

1305
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:27,625
Baloch is spilling
a lot of blood for freedom.

1306
01:37:29,291 --> 01:37:30,875
You should try spilling some ink for it.

1307
01:37:31,166 --> 01:37:35,041
Who knows, you might end up
helping Balochistan gain its freedom.

1308
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:36,875
Rehman...

1309
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:41,333
- Donga!
- Yeah?

1310
01:37:44,333 --> 01:37:45,291
Shirani <i>sahab,</i> this is...

1311
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:49,583
a small gift from us,
especially for you.

1312
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:55,291
And this is a short list
of what we're looking for.

1313
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:03,791
Can we get it before the first Thursday
of next month?

1314
01:38:07,375 --> 01:38:08,250
Consider it done.

1315
01:38:13,375 --> 01:38:14,541
<i>Yes, by God</i>

1316
01:38:16,541 --> 01:38:17,875
<i>Flipperachi!</i>

1317
01:38:17,875 --> 01:38:19,833
<i>Bro, go for it
I've got a great vibe going</i>

1318
01:38:19,833 --> 01:38:22,208
<i>Bro, you'll win
This dance is amazing</i>

1319
01:38:22,208 --> 01:38:24,541
<i>Bro, go for it
I've got a great vibe going</i>

1320
01:38:24,541 --> 01:38:26,875
<i>Bro, you'll win
This dance is amazing</i>

1321
01:38:26,875 --> 01:38:29,166
<i>I've got a strong dance move for you
My friend</i>

1322
01:38:29,166 --> 01:38:31,583
<i>It's called Sabouha
Destiny itself proposed to her</i>

1323
01:38:31,583 --> 01:38:34,291
<i>Stretch your hand next to you
And give it a slap</i>

1324
01:38:34,291 --> 01:38:36,291
<i>Shake your shoulder
This way and stay sturdy</i>

1325
01:38:36,291 --> 01:38:37,958
<i>Give me the prey dance</i>

1326
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:40,458
<i>Add some more, I've got the money</i>

1327
01:38:40,458 --> 01:38:42,708
<i>For the pro, that we know is a catch</i>

1328
01:38:42,708 --> 01:38:45,083
<i>The one acting all high and mighty</i>

1329
01:38:45,083 --> 01:38:46,875
<i>Okay, then, do a dance for me</i>

1330
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,250
<i>Come on, bring me a karak tea</i>

1331
01:38:49,250 --> 01:38:50,958
<i>Hey, get the car, let's go...</i>

1332
01:38:57,333 --> 01:38:58,833
Arshad Pappu can still be handled,

1333
01:38:59,791 --> 01:39:02,333
but Rehman Dakait is getting
way too full of himself these days.

1334
01:39:02,458 --> 01:39:05,916
I had a chance to take him down
in an encounter back in 1997,

1335
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:08,333
but you stepped in and saved him.

1336
01:39:09,791 --> 01:39:11,000
He's your loyalist, isn't he?

1337
01:39:12,125 --> 01:39:15,250
You backed him all these years
because it served your political needs.

1338
01:39:16,041 --> 01:39:18,583
And now I hear he wants
to contest Lyari's elections.

1339
01:39:19,791 --> 01:39:22,791
You can't put "loyal"
and "politics" in the same sentence.

1340
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:25,333
Rehman's loyal to nobody.

1341
01:39:26,666 --> 01:39:30,708
You expect loyalty from a man
who'd kill his own mother?

1342
01:39:33,833 --> 01:39:35,833
How long have you been suspended?

1343
01:39:36,958 --> 01:39:37,833
Seven years.

1344
01:39:40,041 --> 01:39:41,875
Seven years?

1345
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:47,458
No wonder Lyari went to the dogs
in these seven years.

1346
01:39:48,166 --> 01:39:51,958
I swear, this country has no value
for real talent.

1347
01:39:53,791 --> 01:39:55,791
You're the one
who got me suspended.

1348
01:39:56,791 --> 01:39:57,833
Me?

1349
01:39:58,666 --> 01:39:59,541
No way.

1350
01:40:00,291 --> 01:40:01,500
That's impossible.

1351
01:40:01,875 --> 01:40:02,750
No.

1352
01:40:03,083 --> 01:40:03,958
Really?

1353
01:40:04,458 --> 01:40:05,333
I...

1354
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:07,541
That was ages ago.

1355
01:40:07,541 --> 01:40:09,125
I barely remember.

1356
01:40:09,875 --> 01:40:13,833
Probably because of some reckless,
impulsive mistake...

1357
01:40:14,166 --> 01:40:15,041
made by you.

1358
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:19,083
Anyway, let's get to the point.

1359
01:40:19,083 --> 01:40:21,833
I want Lyari wiped clean.

1360
01:40:22,416 --> 01:40:25,000
No filth, no gangsters.

1361
01:40:25,875 --> 01:40:31,166
And the first step is posting
you back there.

1362
01:40:32,208 --> 01:40:34,916
Seven years of all

1363
01:40:36,083 --> 01:40:38,291
that fire boiling inside you...

1364
01:40:39,375 --> 01:40:40,916
I want it to be used the right way.

1365
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:43,833
It's burning inside you, right?

1366
01:40:44,958 --> 01:40:45,833
Good.

1367
01:40:46,458 --> 01:40:48,333
This is your reinstatement letter.

1368
01:40:48,541 --> 01:40:51,041
Go fix Lyari,

1369
01:40:51,333 --> 01:40:53,833
my brave son.

1370
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,916
Here you go.
Take it.

1371
01:40:58,208 --> 01:41:01,125
It's nice to see you circle
back to me.

1372
01:41:02,708 --> 01:41:05,625
But I cannot do this.

1373
01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:16,166
The filth you want cleaned up...

1374
01:41:16,916 --> 01:41:18,583
I can't do it alone.

1375
01:41:19,541 --> 01:41:23,958
Every cop in Lyari is
in on Rehman Dakait's payroll.

1376
01:41:25,041 --> 01:41:28,541
I'll be dead before
my first shootout.

1377
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:30,583
Then what's the solution?

1378
01:41:33,416 --> 01:41:35,125
Lyari Task Force.

1379
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:37,583
Made only of my boys.

1380
01:41:38,166 --> 01:41:40,541
I need army weapons and funding

1381
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:44,083
so my men don't need
bribes to survive.

1382
01:41:44,625 --> 01:41:46,791
We'll have a secret base
of operations.

1383
01:41:47,541 --> 01:41:50,375
No outsider should ever
know where it is.

1384
01:41:50,916 --> 01:41:52,125
Another important point.

1385
01:41:53,166 --> 01:41:56,166
Nobody interferes with my methods.

1386
01:41:57,583 --> 01:41:58,625
Not even you.

1387
01:41:59,916 --> 01:42:02,708
Then and only then

1388
01:42:03,625 --> 01:42:05,583
will I take responsibility
for Lyari.

1389
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:10,125
Otherwise, I'm living quite comfortably
thanks to <i>Bade sahab.</i>

1390
01:42:18,416 --> 01:42:21,041
So, SP, you'll be joining
on the 12th.

1391
01:42:21,041 --> 01:42:22,708
Don't make me look bad, alright?

1392
01:42:26,291 --> 01:42:28,208
Are you going to college
or coming back home?

1393
01:42:28,625 --> 01:42:29,666
I'm going for my coaching classes.

1394
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,333
I need some money, Dad.

1395
01:42:31,708 --> 01:42:32,666
Why?

1396
01:42:33,125 --> 01:42:35,458
It's the third, I have
to pay my coaching fees.

1397
01:42:35,791 --> 01:42:38,000
Didn't your Mom tell you
you're not going to coaching anymore?

1398
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:39,250
Are you giving me the money,

1399
01:42:39,625 --> 01:42:41,083
or should I arrange it myself?

1400
01:42:42,291 --> 01:42:44,750
I'll smack you so hard all your
"arrangements"

1401
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:46,750
will fall out of your mouth.

1402
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:48,458
You're just like your Mom.

1403
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:50,708
Money doesn't grow
on trees, you know.

1404
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:52,416
We work our butts off for it.

1405
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,250
And you women never stop with...
"Buy me lipstick, buy me sandals..."

1406
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:55,208
Get lost from here.

1407
01:42:57,291 --> 01:42:59,291
Go. I've given you enough.
Don't stand here counting it.

1408
01:42:59,291 --> 01:43:00,291
Thank you.

1409
01:43:06,291 --> 01:43:08,416

01:44:42,375 --> 01:44:45,916

Yalina?

1455
01:45:40,958 --> 01:45:41,833
Alone?

1456
01:45:44,833 --> 01:45:45,708
What happened?

1457
01:45:45,875 --> 01:45:47,791
What's your dad's problem anyway?

1458
01:45:48,333 --> 01:45:49,666
He's not a bad man deep down.

1459
01:45:50,375 --> 01:45:52,166
Just imagine,
he grew up an orphan,

1460
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:54,791
spent his whole youth trying
to plant himself in politics.

1461
01:45:55,166 --> 01:45:58,916
He got married at 45
to a woman who was 27.

1462
01:45:59,458 --> 01:46:01,166
<i>I was born when he was 48.</i>

1463
01:46:01,708 --> 01:46:02,583
<i>He became a father at an age</i>

1464
01:46:02,583 --> 01:46:03,541
<i>where most men are
becoming grandfathers.</i>

1465
01:46:03,541 --> 01:46:05,250
<i>No wonder our worlds don't match.</i>

1466
01:46:05,416 --> 01:46:06,291
And on top of that,

1467
01:46:06,291 --> 01:46:09,125
kids from political families have
a hundred restrictions.

1468
01:46:09,125 --> 01:46:11,375
A normal person would choke
to death living like that.

1469
01:46:14,208 --> 01:46:15,666
Medical is just an excuse...

1470
01:46:16,375 --> 01:46:18,500
I just want to get out of that house.

1471
01:46:18,916 --> 01:46:20,166
If I stay there too long,

1472
01:46:20,333 --> 01:46:22,791
Dad will marry me off to some
"burger kid".

1473
01:46:23,583 --> 01:46:26,041
If not a "burger kid,"
then who do you want to marry?

1474
01:47:05,333 --> 01:47:06,333
Welcome, welcome.

1475
01:47:06,333 --> 01:47:08,458

Who, Atif Aslam?

1480
01:47:17,833 --> 01:47:18,750
Where had he gone?

1481
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,500
Oh, you mean SP Chaudhary Aslam.

1482
01:47:23,083 --> 01:47:27,083
Zarwari <i>sahab</i> loves digging
up old graves.

SP Aslam.

1523
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:14,958
Come here.

01:49:20,375 --> 01:49:22,333
{\an8}Keep an eye on him

1525
01:49:24,458 --> 01:49:26,000
Is this man a threat to you?

1526
01:49:39,208 --> 01:49:43,125
Sir, in March 2005,
Javed Khanani and ISI Major Iqbal

1527
01:49:43,125 --> 01:49:47,458
had meetings in Dubai with one
of our ministers and his son,

1528
01:49:47,875 --> 01:49:49,416
and they signed a massive deal.

1529
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:50,750
It was decided that from then on,

1530
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:53,791
India would also source the raw
material for its currency notes

1531
01:49:53,958 --> 01:49:57,125
from the same British company
that supplies Pakistan.

1532
01:49:59,333 --> 01:50:00,333
Lazarus Du.

1533
01:50:06,916 --> 01:50:09,416
All the raw material used for making

1534
01:50:09,416 --> 01:50:11,083
our fake currency is supplied
to Pakistan through this company.

1535
01:50:11,083 --> 01:50:12,958
Which is why their quality
is as good as real.

1536
01:50:13,083 --> 01:50:14,583
But how did they get the plates?

1537
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:16,416
In January 2007,

1538
01:50:16,416 --> 01:50:19,750
a few design changes
were made in the MG2005 series,

1539
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:22,333
so new plates were
produced by Lazarus.

1540
01:50:23,666 --> 01:50:26,916
Our minister and his son collected
those plates in London,

1541
01:50:26,916 --> 01:50:28,000
and on their way back,

1542
01:50:28,541 --> 01:50:30,958
their private jet developed
a technical fault

1543
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:32,708
and they halted
in Dubai for a couple of hours.

1544
01:50:36,458 --> 01:50:39,833
<i>We believe they met Javed Khanani</i>

1545
01:50:39,833 --> 01:50:41,041
<i>and Major Iqbal again during
that layover</i>

1546
01:50:41,041 --> 01:50:43,708
<i>and handed over replicas
of the plates in a Dubai hotel.</i>

1547
01:50:53,833 --> 01:50:56,666
<i>Almost top 33 senior most
high level bureaucrats</i>

1548
01:50:56,666 --> 01:50:58,708
<i>and officers were part
of this deal.</i>

1549
01:50:59,125 --> 01:51:01,875
<i>Millions were transferred from
Javed Khanani's London account</i>

1550
01:51:01,875 --> 01:51:05,458
<i>into the offshore accounts of
our minister and these officers.</i>

1551
01:51:05,666 --> 01:51:08,333
<i>Sir, I think we should take
immediate action against them.</i>

1552
01:51:10,875 --> 01:51:12,541
We're powerless against them.

1553
01:51:13,333 --> 01:51:14,208
Sir...

1554
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:15,708
Even if we expose them,

1555
01:51:16,333 --> 01:51:19,958
these ministers
will cry political vendetta

1556
01:51:20,583 --> 01:51:22,000
and get us blacklisted.

1557
01:51:22,125 --> 01:51:24,541
But, sir, we can't stay silent either.

1558
01:51:25,083 --> 01:51:25,958
Bansal,

1559
01:51:27,333 --> 01:51:30,166
do you know
the best thing about fate?

1560
01:51:33,750 --> 01:51:35,333
It shifts when the time is right.

1561
01:51:37,791 --> 01:51:39,000
Our time will come.

1562
01:51:42,583 --> 01:51:43,583
Until then,

1563
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:44,916
watch...

1564
01:51:46,333 --> 01:51:47,208
and wait...

1565
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:57,750
Khanani <i>sahab,</i>
we're heading out in five minutes.

1566
01:51:58,250 --> 01:51:59,916
Don't worry, we'll be there.

1567
01:52:01,291 --> 01:52:02,166
Goodbye.

1568
01:52:02,916 --> 01:52:04,000
- Donga!
- Yeah?

1569
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,958
Go inside

1570
01:52:04,958 --> 01:52:06,208
- and tell Rehman <i>bhai</i> to move it.
- Okay.

1571
01:52:06,208 --> 01:52:08,208
Khanani keeps blowing up
my phone from the factory.

1572
01:52:08,208 --> 01:52:09,916
- Donga! Donga!
- It's clear everyone's waiting on us.

1573
01:52:09,916 --> 01:52:11,541
- Yes, <i>bhai?</i>
- Get the engines running.

1574
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:13,250
- Yes, <i>bhai.
- Bhai,</i> he...

1575
01:52:13,250 --> 01:52:15,083
Take the goods
and leave for Khanani's.

1576
01:52:15,083 --> 01:52:16,625
- Faizal has suddenly fallen sick.
- Let's go.

1577
01:52:16,625 --> 01:52:17,583
- Start the car.
- I'm taking him to the hospital.

1578
01:52:17,583 --> 01:52:18,666
We'll come with you, <i>bhai.</i>

1579
01:52:18,666 --> 01:52:20,291
You all go.
I've got Donga with me.

1580
01:52:20,291 --> 01:52:22,333
Listen, make sure they pay
the full amount upfront.

1581
01:52:22,458 --> 01:52:23,791
Khananis can't be trusted.

1582
01:52:24,291 --> 01:52:25,166
Okay.

1583
01:52:25,166 --> 01:52:26,125
Let's go.

1584
01:52:26,125 --> 01:52:27,291
Drive already!
Go.

1585
01:52:27,791 --> 01:52:29,666
All of you go with Rehman <i>bhai.</i>

1586
01:52:29,875 --> 01:52:30,791
Let's go.

1587
01:52:31,791 --> 01:52:33,166
What are you lot waiting for?

1588
01:52:33,166 --> 01:52:35,291
- Get in. Get moving.
- Get in the car.

1589
01:52:35,791 --> 01:52:37,375
- Is everything loaded or not?
- Yes, <i>bhai.</i>

1590
01:52:58,291 --> 01:52:59,250
What's on your mind?

1591
01:53:00,333 --> 01:53:01,250
Everything alright?

1592
01:53:46,083 --> 01:53:47,166
<i>Salam alaykum.</i>

1593
01:53:48,208 --> 01:53:49,458
As promised, delivery on Thursday.

1594
01:53:52,166 --> 01:53:53,875
<i>Wa'alaykumu s-salam.</i>

1595
01:53:54,125 --> 01:53:55,916
- Everything alright, Cheema <i>sahab?</i>
- All good.

1596
01:53:57,583 --> 01:53:59,000
- How are you, <i>bhai?</i>
- Uzair <i>miyan!</i>

1597
01:54:03,583 --> 01:54:04,458
Check everything.

1598
01:54:05,708 --> 01:54:07,375
We've got everything in the list.

1599
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:09,625
Amazing.

1600
01:54:10,916 --> 01:54:13,916
Ajmal, Ismail,
don't be shy, go on, pick it up.

1601
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,166
We brought them especially for you.

1602
01:54:46,125 --> 01:54:47,625
Rehman really outdid himself.

1603
01:54:48,583 --> 01:54:49,458
Why didn't he show up?

1604
01:54:50,125 --> 01:54:51,958
He got tied up somewhere,
so he couldn't come.

1605
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:53,375
He has sent his regards.

1606
01:55:06,958 --> 01:55:09,250
{\an8}Watch out, Donga!

1607
01:55:52,666 --> 01:55:53,708
Rehman!

1608
01:55:56,625 --> 01:55:59,250
Uzair, Hamza,
you're sure you don't want some?

1609
01:55:59,583 --> 01:56:01,083
No, Javed <i>bhai.</i>
We'll head out as soon

1610
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,416
- as the boys finish loading up.
- Don't put it in the boot,

1611
01:56:03,583 --> 01:56:04,458
keep it in the back seat.

1612
01:56:04,458 --> 01:56:05,416
It won't take long.

1613
01:56:07,416 --> 01:56:09,750
<i>- The cry of Takbir...
- Allah is the greatest!</i>

1614
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:12,208
So, are the boys ready
to leave tomorrow?

1615
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:14,625
No.

1616
01:56:18,041 --> 01:56:19,333
- Donga, Siyahi...
- Yes, <i>bhai?</i>

1617
01:56:19,333 --> 01:56:20,666
- You two get going,
- What about you, <i>bhai?</i>

1618
01:56:20,916 --> 01:56:23,250
and tell Uzair to inform Jameel.

1619
01:56:24,250 --> 01:56:25,833
But Khan <i>bhai,</i> he's the SP!

1620
01:56:30,166 --> 01:56:31,583
If you two stay here,

1621
01:56:31,958 --> 01:56:33,166
this boy won't make it out alive.

1622
01:56:48,958 --> 01:56:50,541
Weren't they supposed
to move on Friday?

1623
01:56:51,291 --> 01:56:52,958
Yes, that was the plan.

1624
01:56:54,708 --> 01:56:56,250
But we learned someone tipped off

1625
01:56:58,541 --> 01:57:02,583
Indian Intelligence about our arrival.

1626
01:57:05,250 --> 01:57:06,708
They were waiting for us.

1627
01:57:07,625 --> 01:57:10,708
Rehman, my friend...

1628
01:57:11,458 --> 01:57:13,416
{\an8}Should I punch just your ticket
to heaven,

1629
01:57:13,416 --> 01:57:16,000
{\an8}or do you want to take your wife
and kid along too?

1630
01:57:16,791 --> 01:57:18,291
Once they arrest me,

1631
01:57:18,750 --> 01:57:20,291
take him straight to the hospital, understand?

1632
01:57:20,291 --> 01:57:21,250
Rehman...

1633
01:57:21,791 --> 01:57:23,250
They won't hurt you.

1634
01:57:51,666 --> 01:57:52,541
Anyway...

1635
01:57:55,875 --> 01:57:57,666
This plan is on hold until <i>Bade sahab</i>

1636
01:57:59,541 --> 01:58:00,750
gives the green light.

1637
01:58:21,541 --> 01:58:23,208
And the best part is...

1638
01:58:25,583 --> 01:58:27,166
we know exactly who the snitch is.

1639
01:58:54,041 --> 01:58:54,916
Come.

1640
01:58:59,416 --> 01:59:00,416
Uzair <i>miyan,</i> please join us.

1641
01:59:04,833 --> 01:59:05,708
Follow me.

1642
01:59:14,958 --> 01:59:15,875
Speak up!

1643
01:59:16,458 --> 01:59:17,416
Speak up now!

1644
01:59:21,291 --> 01:59:22,583
Come on, Sajid,

1645
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:24,708
what are you doing,
having sex with him or what?

1646
01:59:25,541 --> 01:59:27,416
He's an Indian spy.

1647
01:59:28,083 --> 01:59:29,833
These guys are tough as nails.

1648
01:59:31,541 --> 01:59:32,791
You whip him like that,

1649
01:59:32,791 --> 01:59:35,666
he'll flip it on you
and make you his ride.

1650
01:59:36,750 --> 01:59:37,791
Wait, let me show you
how this is done.

1651
01:59:40,666 --> 01:59:42,791
After the 1971 war,

1652
01:59:43,708 --> 01:59:47,000
there was an atmosphere
of gloom in Pakistan.

1653
01:59:47,833 --> 01:59:49,041
I was six years old...

1654
01:59:50,416 --> 01:59:51,375
listening to the radio...

1655
01:59:52,708 --> 01:59:53,708
At that time,

1656
01:59:54,416 --> 01:59:57,958
Zia-ul-Haq said something
that I never forgot.

1657
01:59:58,791 --> 02:00:01,125
Bleed India with a thousand cuts.

1658
02:00:02,666 --> 02:00:04,500
Just like these

1659
02:00:05,125 --> 02:00:08,208
countless tiny incisions in his body,

1660
02:00:09,583 --> 02:00:10,625
I swear on God,

1661
02:00:11,791 --> 02:00:14,791
I will make that country suffer
a fate worse than this.

1662
02:00:17,791 --> 02:00:20,000
But for now, in the name of Allah,

1663
02:00:20,375 --> 02:00:21,375
let's begin with this.

1664
02:00:22,833 --> 02:00:23,750
Speak up.

1665
02:00:25,166 --> 02:00:28,833
How many infidel agents
came with you?

1666
02:00:28,833 --> 02:00:30,291
Where are they deployed?

1667
02:00:33,083 --> 02:00:33,958
Karachi?

1668
02:00:33,958 --> 02:00:35,250
Rawalpindi?

1669
02:00:35,916 --> 02:00:37,500
Get talking, son.

1670
02:00:44,583 --> 02:00:47,208
I don't want to kill you.

1671
02:00:47,416 --> 02:00:50,250
Just tell me where they are.

1672
02:00:50,875 --> 02:00:51,833
How many of them are here?

1673
02:00:52,125 --> 02:00:53,833
You crossed into my country!

1674
02:00:54,791 --> 02:00:55,666
Talk!

1675
02:00:56,208 --> 02:00:57,250
Speak up!

1676
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:05,833
These bastards don't understand
the language of love.

1677
02:01:05,833 --> 02:01:08,416
Tell me!
Where are they deployed?

1678
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:10,416
Speak up!

1679
02:01:14,416 --> 02:01:15,291
Speak up!

1680
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,916
Yeah, Donga,
everything alright at the hospital?

1681
02:01:32,916 --> 02:01:35,666
<i>Bhai,</i> they've arrested Rehman <i>bhai</i>
at the Mai Kolach bridge!

1682
02:01:40,416 --> 02:01:41,583
Who dared to do that?!

1683
02:01:41,958 --> 02:01:44,375
That rascal SP...
Chaudhary Aslam!

1684
02:01:46,708 --> 02:01:48,083
The SP?! Dang!

1685
02:01:48,458 --> 02:01:51,208
Rehman <i>bhai</i> said you must
inform Jameel <i>bhai</i> immediately.

1686
02:01:59,333 --> 02:02:01,708
<i>Change of pace and a great breakthrough.</i>

1687
02:02:01,708 --> 02:02:05,166
Hey Uzair, my boy,
what made you think of me today?

1688
02:02:05,166 --> 02:02:06,708
Jameel <i>bhai,</i> listen carefully,

1689
02:02:06,958 --> 02:02:10,125
SP Aslam has arrested Rehman
at Mai Kolach bridge.

1690
02:02:10,125 --> 02:02:11,875
What? Rehman got arrested?

1691
02:02:12,166 --> 02:02:13,458
Don't worry, my boy,

1692
02:02:13,458 --> 02:02:14,916
your Uncle Jameel
will sort everything out.

1693
02:02:15,083 --> 02:02:15,958
I'll take care of it.

1694
02:02:15,958 --> 02:02:17,750
Just hurry, please.
Do something fast.

1695
02:02:19,125 --> 02:02:20,833
<i>The ball was close.
A beautiful shot.</i>

1696
02:02:22,916 --> 02:02:26,541
Come on, Misba!
Another dropped catch?

1697
02:02:26,916 --> 02:02:28,166
I had money riding on that!

1698
02:02:31,208 --> 02:02:32,916
Jameel <i>bhai</i> will handle it.

1699
02:02:33,291 --> 02:02:35,625
- We need to gather all the boys--
- Head back home.

1700
02:02:38,666 --> 02:02:40,250
Uzair, home, now!

1701
02:02:55,333 --> 02:02:57,083
I've waited 12 years...

1702
02:02:58,291 --> 02:03:01,291
to see your blood on my shirt.

1703
02:03:02,166 --> 02:03:04,333
This is Rehman Dakait's blood
we're talking about, SP <i>sahab,</i>

1704
02:03:06,041 --> 02:03:07,291
spill it wisely.

1705
02:03:12,916 --> 02:03:13,833
Thrash the bastard!

1706
02:03:27,125 --> 02:03:28,041
Aqlaakh!

1707
02:03:28,166 --> 02:03:30,500
Get everyone in Lyari moving.

1708
02:03:30,708 --> 02:03:32,125
I want updates on every step

1709
02:03:32,125 --> 02:03:34,458
- that LTF van takes.
- Okay, <i>bhai.</i>

1710
02:03:34,958 --> 02:03:35,875
Aqlaakh!

1711
02:03:38,666 --> 02:03:39,541
Aqlaakh!

1712
02:03:40,666 --> 02:03:41,541
Yes, brother?

1713
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:44,208
You...

1714
02:03:44,625 --> 02:03:45,625
Have you lost your mind?

1715
02:03:48,208 --> 02:03:49,333
What did you put in the kid's food?

1716
02:03:49,333 --> 02:03:50,708
How can you accuse me like that?

1717
02:03:51,250 --> 02:03:53,000
- I've worked here 40 years!
- Get talking, Aqlaakh!

1718
02:03:53,208 --> 02:03:54,291
I don't know what you're talking about.

1719
02:03:56,041 --> 02:03:58,875
Speak before I finish you.

1720
02:04:00,833 --> 02:04:02,041
Who's with sister-in-law
at the hospital?

1721
02:04:02,041 --> 02:04:03,000
Don't know, <i>bhai.</i>

1722
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,208
Send someone there right now!

1723
02:04:09,083 --> 02:04:10,375
Where are they taking
Rehman <i>bhai?</i>

1724
02:04:10,958 --> 02:04:12,791
- I swear, I don't know.
- Don't know?

1725
02:04:12,791 --> 02:04:13,791
What are you talking about?

1726
02:04:14,666 --> 02:04:18,458
- Come here.
- Where are you taking me, brother?

1727
02:04:23,833 --> 02:04:26,791
- For God's sake, let me go.
- I'm giving you one last chance, Aqlaakh.

1728
02:04:26,791 --> 02:04:27,958
Speak up, or I'll carve out your kidneys

1729
02:04:27,958 --> 02:04:30,250
- and liver and make you eat them yourself.
- I don't know... I really don't know.

1730
02:04:30,375 --> 02:04:31,250
You sure?

1731
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:32,958
I don't know, brother.

1732
02:04:32,958 --> 02:04:34,541
Hamza, what are you doing?

1733
02:04:34,666 --> 02:04:35,541
Stop right there!

1734
02:04:35,916 --> 02:04:37,250
What are you doing, brother?

1735
02:04:38,791 --> 02:04:40,833
- Who's behind this?
- Hamza, what's gotten into you?

1736
02:04:40,958 --> 02:04:42,458
- I don't know, brother.
- You really don't know?

1737
02:04:42,583 --> 02:04:43,541
I don't know.

1738
02:04:44,250 --> 02:04:46,125
- Hamza...
- Arshad Pappu!

1739
02:04:46,125 --> 02:04:47,083
Who?!

1740
02:04:48,208 --> 02:04:50,166
- Arshad Pappu!
- What?

1741
02:04:51,875 --> 02:04:54,041
Arshad Pappu!

1742
02:04:54,791 --> 02:04:56,791
Arshad Pappu?

1743
02:05:03,250 --> 02:05:06,791
They gave me a liquid
to mix into Faizal's milk...

1744
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:14,416
How much did you sell your soul for,
Aqlaakh?

1745
02:05:15,250 --> 02:05:16,125
Speak up!

1746
02:05:16,541 --> 02:05:18,916
How dare you...
you betrayed my brother!

1747
02:05:19,083 --> 02:05:20,833
You betrayed Rehman <i>bhai!</i>

1748
02:05:21,208 --> 02:05:22,875
Brother, it was a mistake...

1749
02:05:23,166 --> 02:05:26,125
Brother... it was a mistake...

1750
02:05:26,125 --> 02:05:29,208
Brother, no...
it was a mistake...

1751
02:05:29,458 --> 02:05:31,041
Brother, please forgive me.

1752
02:05:31,041 --> 02:05:32,000
Yalina.

1753
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,500
I've been calling you forever...
Where are you?

1754
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:35,625
Yalina, I'm busy with something.

1755
02:05:35,625 --> 02:05:36,708
I'll call you back.

1756
02:05:37,083 --> 02:05:40,041
My love, at least check
your messages.

1757
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:42,000
I sent you a gift.

1758
02:05:42,791 --> 02:05:43,666
<i>Keep an eye on your dad.</i>

1759
02:05:43,666 --> 02:05:46,125
<i>Keep an eye on the SP.
Dad-SP-SP-Dad.</i>

1760
02:05:46,750 --> 02:05:48,875
I've kept such a good eye on them,

1761
02:05:48,875 --> 02:05:51,333
<i>you'll surely run here
and kiss me when you find out.</i>

1762
02:05:53,250 --> 02:05:55,833
<i>Fine, Lyari is yours
for the taking.</i>

1763
02:05:56,541 --> 02:05:59,041
<i>SP, you'll take care of the rest, right?</i>

1764
02:05:59,958 --> 02:06:01,250
Yalina, where exactly
are you right now?

1765
02:06:01,375 --> 02:06:02,291
Are you actually coming here?

1766
02:06:02,458 --> 02:06:03,333
Dolmen Mall.

1767
02:06:03,625 --> 02:06:05,000
I'm dead serious, Yalina.

1768
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,166
Leave the mall, go to my place,
and switch off your phone.

1769
02:06:07,166 --> 02:06:08,916
And don't step out till I get there.

1770
02:06:13,375 --> 02:06:14,250
Hamza?

1771
02:06:14,458 --> 02:06:15,916
<i>- Yalina, go home.</i>
- Hello?

1772
02:06:32,458 --> 02:06:34,250
<i>One run from two balls.</i>

1773
02:06:35,041 --> 02:06:37,500
<i>The moment the shot was taken, they ran.
A thunderous appeal goes up,</i>

1774
02:06:38,375 --> 02:06:40,541
<i>but the umpire isn't convinced at all.</i>

1775
02:06:41,083 --> 02:06:43,458
<i>Both sides are now level on 195.</i>

1776
02:06:45,208 --> 02:06:46,083
<i>Concerned...</i>

1777
02:06:46,083 --> 02:06:48,000
<i>First, I want Rehman's head...</i>

1778
02:06:48,666 --> 02:06:49,583
<i>and then Lyari...</i>

1779
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,458
<i>But still hanging on to plenty of hope.</i>

1780
02:06:51,458 --> 02:06:53,166
<i>One run needed off one ball.</i>

1781
02:07:12,708 --> 02:07:14,541
First, I want Rehman's head...

1782
02:07:15,875 --> 02:07:16,875
and then Lyari...

1783
02:07:17,958 --> 02:07:19,333
at any cost.

1784
02:07:20,666 --> 02:07:24,500
And it'll be my job to get Rehman
out of the house alone.

1785
02:07:26,791 --> 02:07:29,166
Fine, Lyari is yours
for the taking.

1786
02:07:29,291 --> 02:07:30,250
Enjoy.

1787
02:07:30,791 --> 02:07:33,541
But listen, don't go sniffing around

1788
02:07:33,541 --> 02:07:36,000
those Muslim Movement Party beggars.

1789
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:38,041
They're bloody broke.

1790
02:07:38,666 --> 02:07:41,458
Don't worry, Arshad,
you're my boy.

1791
02:07:42,458 --> 02:07:45,208
<i>Take a puff...</i>

1792
02:07:46,041 --> 02:07:50,916
- SP, you'll take care of the rest, right?
<i>- And let the sorrows fade</i>

1793
02:07:53,541 --> 02:07:56,750
<i>Chant day and night...</i>

1794
02:07:56,750 --> 02:08:04,625
<i>Glory to Lord Krishna and Lord Ram</i>

1795
02:08:08,625 --> 02:08:10,625
Jameel <i>sahab,</i> Hamza Ali Mazari here.

1796
02:08:11,333 --> 02:08:14,500
You've got one hour to have
Rehman <i>bhai</i> at Shershah Bridge, alive.

1797
02:08:16,041 --> 02:08:17,875
If he's not there,
this video becomes tonight's

1798
02:08:17,875 --> 02:08:19,208
breaking news on every channel.

1799
02:08:20,833 --> 02:08:23,458
Choose your next step wisely,
Jameel <i>sahab...</i>

1800
02:08:27,208 --> 02:08:30,250
You see, your daughter is with me.

1801
02:08:33,458 --> 02:08:34,333
Yalina!

1802
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:36,791
Yalina!

1803
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:38,666
Yalina, where are you?!

1804
02:08:39,083 --> 02:08:40,041
Yalina!

1805
02:08:40,208 --> 02:08:41,125
What's going on?

1806
02:08:41,125 --> 02:08:42,166
Why are you shouting like this?

1807
02:08:42,333 --> 02:08:43,250
Where's Yalina?

1808
02:08:43,541 --> 02:08:44,583
She's at a mall.

1809
02:08:44,708 --> 02:08:45,958
She's not at any stupid mall!

1810
02:08:51,208 --> 02:08:53,125
Think you can handle
the pain, kiddo?

1811
02:08:53,833 --> 02:08:56,791
I'll try... kiddo.

1812
02:09:01,208 --> 02:09:02,708
SWINE JAMALI

1813
02:09:07,166 --> 02:09:10,208
I was about to crack his
head open when you called.

1814
02:09:10,500 --> 02:09:13,125
Aslam, don't kill Rehman.

1815
02:09:13,583 --> 02:09:14,458
<i>What?</i>

1816
02:09:14,583 --> 02:09:16,250
Check your phone.

1817
02:09:20,125 --> 02:09:21,916
<i>First, I want Rehman's head...</i>

1818
02:09:22,666 --> 02:09:23,666
<i>and then Lyari...</i>

1819
02:09:24,958 --> 02:09:26,416
<i>at any cost.</i>

1820
02:09:29,416 --> 02:09:30,500
Where did you get this from?

1821
02:09:30,625 --> 02:09:31,750
It doesn't matter!

1822
02:09:32,041 --> 02:09:33,375
If that video comes out,

1823
02:09:33,583 --> 02:09:36,625
my career is over
and my daughter's as good as dead.

1824
02:09:38,583 --> 02:09:39,958
I can't hear you.

1825
02:09:55,916 --> 02:09:56,916
Any word on their van?

1826
02:09:58,541 --> 02:10:01,500
How is it so hard
to track one vehicle?

1827
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:02,458
<i>Hamza...</i>

1828
02:10:02,666 --> 02:10:03,875
Hamza, the SP isn't listening.

1829
02:10:04,375 --> 02:10:05,791
He's not answering my calls either.

1830
02:10:05,916 --> 02:10:07,958
<i>I want to know where SP is, at any cost!</i>

1831
02:10:07,958 --> 02:10:09,458
Where's the Lyari Task Force office?

1832
02:10:14,750 --> 02:10:16,041
I won't repeat myself.

1833
02:10:28,875 --> 02:10:30,416
What are you doing here, ma'am?

1834
02:10:30,625 --> 02:10:31,708
The school's closed.

1835
02:10:31,916 --> 02:10:33,500
You can't be in here
without permission.

1836
02:10:33,791 --> 02:10:34,833
Please leave.

1837
02:10:54,041 --> 02:10:56,458
<i>How dare you arrest my brother,
you rascal!</i>

1838
02:10:57,666 --> 02:10:58,875
- Sir, you need to see this.
<i>- Thrash them.</i>

1839
02:11:02,041 --> 02:11:03,250
<i>How dare you?!</i>

1840
02:11:03,916 --> 02:11:08,500
<i>You've got a lot of nerve these days,
don't you?</i>

1841
02:11:09,375 --> 02:11:10,250
<i>Rascal...</i>

1842
02:11:13,166 --> 02:11:14,083
You...

1843
02:11:15,208 --> 02:11:17,583
You shouldn't have done this.

1844
02:11:17,583 --> 02:11:20,333
You shouldn't have taken my brother.

1845
02:11:20,333 --> 02:11:21,833
You'll pay for what you've done!

1846
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:26,583
Till that Aslam doesn't
release my brother,

1847
02:11:26,833 --> 02:11:30,666
these rascals will stay
hanging right here.

1848
02:11:30,666 --> 02:11:33,375
Tell me where is Rehman <i>bhai!</i>

1849
02:11:33,541 --> 02:11:34,750
Tell me now!

1850
02:11:39,125 --> 02:11:40,333
Don't spare anyone!

1851
02:11:40,708 --> 02:11:42,708
Let them all stay hanging here!

1852
02:11:46,875 --> 02:11:50,291
How dare that SP Aslam arrest my brother!

1853
02:11:50,833 --> 02:11:53,125
Turn them black and blue.

1854
02:11:53,291 --> 02:11:55,666
He should know the consequences!

1855
02:11:56,041 --> 02:11:56,916
You...

1856
02:12:15,666 --> 02:12:16,833
SP Chaudhary Aslam,

1857
02:12:18,916 --> 02:12:20,750
the blaze that'll rise
out of Lyari Task Force

1858
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:22,916
will reduce Karachi to ashes.

1859
02:12:25,333 --> 02:12:28,750
Your 40 men won't even
have bodies left to bury.

1860
02:12:32,166 --> 02:12:33,416
In the next 30 minutes,

1861
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:36,416
I want Rehman <i>bhai</i>
at Shershah Bridge,

1862
02:12:37,458 --> 02:12:38,666
alive and unharmed.

1863
02:12:41,083 --> 02:12:41,958
Goodbye.

1864
02:13:48,458 --> 02:13:49,500
Be careful, <i>bhai.</i>

1865
02:13:51,583 --> 02:13:53,208
Which one of you is Hamza?

1866
02:14:00,916 --> 02:14:01,833
Come here.

1867
02:14:06,250 --> 02:14:07,125
Hamza...

1868
02:14:27,041 --> 02:14:31,166
You lit a spark and thought
you could control the fire?

1869
02:14:34,708 --> 02:14:36,458
Don't fool yourself.

1870
02:14:38,083 --> 02:14:39,791
There's a whole heap of gunpowder here

1871
02:14:39,791 --> 02:14:41,791
enough to reduce men like you to ash.

1872
02:15:25,166 --> 02:15:27,250
You are great, Rehman Baloch!

1873
02:15:34,041 --> 02:15:42,875
Rehman! Rehman! Rehman!

1874
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:48,166
Rehman! Rehman! Rehman!

1875
02:15:52,333 --> 02:15:54,791
<i>Rehman Baloch! Rehman Baloch!</i>

1876
02:16:16,916 --> 02:16:18,083
Come here.

1877
02:16:26,458 --> 02:16:28,208
Who told you about
the Lyari Task Force office?

1878
02:16:29,083 --> 02:16:30,250
Jameel <i>sahab.</i>

1879
02:16:31,083 --> 02:16:32,458
He was worried about you.

1880
02:16:35,583 --> 02:16:37,833
In politics,
all anyone worries about is the throne.

1881
02:16:40,041 --> 02:16:40,958
<i>Bhai,</i>

1882
02:16:41,708 --> 02:16:43,416
he's got a thing going
on with Jameel Jamali's daughter.

1883
02:16:45,208 --> 02:16:49,333
The other day, our boys kept saying,
"Yalina Jamali!"

1884
02:16:50,083 --> 02:16:51,791
Must say that's a big jump!

1885
02:16:53,916 --> 02:16:55,083
Is it love or just lust?

1886
02:16:57,500 --> 02:16:58,375
Love.

1887
02:16:58,833 --> 02:16:59,875
He's brought her home.

1888
02:17:00,583 --> 02:17:02,791
She's staying with him now.

1889
02:17:03,666 --> 02:17:06,500
Poor Jameel's already
lost his daughter.

1890
02:17:07,250 --> 02:17:09,041
And God willing,
he's also about to lose his throne.

1891
02:17:13,291 --> 02:17:15,666
We'll have to find a way to deal
with SP and Arshad Pappu.

1892
02:17:47,541 --> 02:17:48,791
Don't you want to go home?

1893
02:17:49,375 --> 02:17:52,208
If you want to go to my place,
then go.

1894
02:17:54,041 --> 02:17:55,375
I didn't come here just to run back.

1895
02:18:16,041 --> 02:18:17,208
Have we received Khanani's money?

1896
02:18:18,083 --> 02:18:19,041
{\an8}We've got six crores so far, bhai.

1897
02:18:19,208 --> 02:18:20,916
{\an8}Once the remaining
six crores come in,

1898
02:18:20,916 --> 02:18:22,666
no one will be able
to beat our party in Lyari.

1899
02:18:22,666 --> 02:18:24,500
Rehman <i>bhai!</i>

1900
02:18:24,500 --> 02:18:27,000
Your throne in politics
is now guaranteed.

1901
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:28,125
Uzair.

1902
02:18:28,125 --> 02:18:29,125
Hamza.

1903
02:18:29,875 --> 02:18:30,916
Come on, hurry up,

1904
02:18:30,916 --> 02:18:33,750
you're missing the most incredible
moment of our lives.

1905
02:18:34,541 --> 02:18:36,500
We've been eagerly waiting
for you to join us.

1906
02:18:39,291 --> 02:18:40,250
Come.

1907
02:18:40,250 --> 02:18:42,208
- How many have they lost so far?
- God willing, my brother.

1908
02:18:42,458 --> 02:18:43,958
Paradise awaits you.

1909
02:18:43,958 --> 02:18:45,041
<i>If you bring down the ambient
sound just a little bit...</i>

1910
02:18:45,041 --> 02:18:46,541
- Start a fire on several floors.
<i>- Salam.</i>

1911
02:18:46,541 --> 02:18:47,958
<i>- What you are seeing there right now...</i>
- Look, Rehman <i>bhai,</i>

1912
02:18:47,958 --> 02:18:49,791
this is the destruction your guns
and ammo have unleashed.

1913
02:18:49,791 --> 02:18:51,958
Seems like Ghazwa-e-Hind
is starting right here from Mumbai.

1914
02:18:51,958 --> 02:18:55,416
- Please, come and have a seat.
- Come.

1915
02:18:55,416 --> 02:18:57,375
Rehman <i>bhai!</i>

1916
02:18:57,375 --> 02:19:00,166
<i>But do not be mistaken...
It's been driven</i>

1917
02:19:00,333 --> 02:19:03,666
<i>by the terrorist who
attacked the CST Station.</i>

1918
02:19:03,666 --> 02:19:07,083
<i>This police van is not...
It is being driven</i>

1919
02:19:07,333 --> 02:19:11,208
<i>by the terrorist who
attacked the CST Station.</i>

1920
02:19:11,333 --> 02:19:14,000
<i>Presumably, these could
be the same two terrorists</i>

1921
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,875
<i>whose pictures we
just showed you...</i>

1922
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,833
<i>Which shocked many,
he was carrying an AK47 in his hand.</i>

1923
02:19:22,041 --> 02:19:24,375
<i>The look on his face
really told the story there.</i>

1924
02:19:24,583 --> 02:19:28,291
{\an8}<i>A young man in a T-shirt
with a sling on his left arm...</i>

1925
02:19:33,125 --> 02:19:36,041
<i>And carrying what appears
to be either an AK47</i>

1926
02:19:36,166 --> 02:19:38,083
{\an8}<i>or an... or a light machine gun.</i>

1927
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,041
<i>As-salam alaykum,</i> Ali.

1928
02:19:47,041 --> 02:19:48,041
You okay?

1929
02:19:48,333 --> 02:19:50,416
Your target, the Taj Hotel...

1930
02:19:50,916 --> 02:19:53,333
Media is giving it maximum coverage.

1931
02:19:53,333 --> 02:19:55,916
<i>Trapped, still looking out
of their windows, waiting...</i>

1932
02:19:55,916 --> 02:19:57,000
{\an8}Did you start a fire yet?

1933
02:19:58,291 --> 02:19:59,666
My brother,

1934
02:20:00,791 --> 02:20:03,208
unless we see fire blazing,

1935
02:20:03,791 --> 02:20:05,333
the mood doesn't kick in.

1936
02:20:12,666 --> 02:20:14,333
We need to scare them
out of their minds.

1937
02:20:15,375 --> 02:20:18,583
<i>In fact, there has been another
explosion right now.</i>

1938
02:20:18,708 --> 02:20:21,583
<i>Six blasts in about 35 minutes.</i>

1939
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:24,166
Rehman <i>bhai,</i> you've outdone yourself.

1940
02:20:41,208 --> 02:20:42,083
Remember...

1941
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:46,666
Don't spare any Jews
or any foreigners in those rooms.

1942
02:20:47,791 --> 02:20:49,166
They are all infidels.

1943
02:20:49,625 --> 02:20:52,000
Women, kids, old people...

1944
02:20:52,958 --> 02:20:54,791
Kill them all, my brother.

1945
02:20:54,791 --> 02:20:56,416
Every single one
of them is an infidel.

1946
02:20:57,083 --> 02:20:58,375
Don't hesitate.

1947
02:21:07,375 --> 02:21:09,500
<i>Operation Nariman House
commandos came</i>

1948
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:12,166
<i>from the sky, not the street.</i>

1949
02:21:17,125 --> 02:21:21,791
Listen, Indian commandos
are entering from the fifth floor.

1950
02:21:22,958 --> 02:21:24,708
Throw a handful of grenades at them.

1951
02:21:30,583 --> 02:21:32,583
<i>More than 80 people are dead.</i>

1952
02:21:32,583 --> 02:21:34,166
<i>Several hundred were injured.</i>

1953
02:21:34,416 --> 02:21:36,666
<i>Forty hostages taken.</i>

1954
02:21:37,625 --> 02:21:48,541
<i>- The cry of Takbir...
- Allah is the greatest!</i>

1955
02:21:48,750 --> 02:21:59,291
<i>- The cry of Takbir...
- Allah is the greatest!</i>

1956
02:22:00,458 --> 02:22:01,458
Allah is the greatest!

1957
02:22:16,541 --> 02:22:17,541
<i>All right, God willing.</i>

1958
02:22:19,208 --> 02:22:20,750
<i>You have to be strong, my brother.</i>

1959
02:22:21,083 --> 02:22:22,041
<i>There's no need to panic.</i>

1960
02:22:22,041 --> 02:22:23,000
<i>- Not at all.
- God willing,</i>

1961
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,875
<i>even if a bullet tears through you,</i>

1962
02:22:24,875 --> 02:22:25,916
<i>this mission still counts as a win.</i>

1963
02:22:25,916 --> 02:22:29,125
<i>- Yes, yes.
- Allah is waiting for you in heaven.</i>

1964
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:30,166
<i>God willing.</i>

1965
02:22:30,458 --> 02:22:32,291
<i>Umar, take cover! Take cover now!</i>

1966
02:22:36,541 --> 02:22:38,375
<i>Put a bullet in every person
that you see.</i>

1967
02:22:38,375 --> 02:22:40,208
<i>We've already killed a commando
right at the damn entry.</i>

1968
02:22:40,375 --> 02:22:41,500
<i>Not yet, but soon, God willing.</i>

1969
02:22:41,500 --> 02:22:44,875
<i>All praise to Allah, all praise to
Allah...</i>

1970
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,291
<i>- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.</i>

1971
02:22:46,625 --> 02:22:49,208
<i>Should we keep some alive
or just kill them all?</i>

1972
02:22:49,708 --> 02:22:52,875
<i>Listen up,
destroy each and every one of them.</i>

1973
02:22:52,875 --> 02:22:54,000
<i>And save your own ass from this mess.</i>

1974
02:22:54,375 --> 02:22:56,791
<i>The whole point is that
you hold them in such a way that</i>

1975
02:22:57,208 --> 02:23:02,041
<i>the bullet doesn't bounce off
and come flying back into your face.</i>

1976
02:23:02,500 --> 02:23:03,583
<i>God willing.</i>

1977
02:23:03,583 --> 02:23:07,583
<i>Make them sit facing forward,</i>

1978
02:23:08,333 --> 02:23:10,958
<i>and put a bullet straight through
the back of their head.</i>

1979
02:23:11,250 --> 02:23:12,125
<i>Hello?</i>

1980
02:23:12,125 --> 02:23:15,083
<i>- You talk to them, you talk to them.
- I have already talked to them.</i>

1981
02:23:15,083 --> 02:23:19,208
<i>I was talking to the Consulate
just a few seconds ago and...</i>

1982
02:23:19,208 --> 02:23:20,208
<i>Don't worry, ma'am.</i>

1983
02:23:20,625 --> 02:23:25,000
<i>Just sit back and relax, and don't worry,
and just wait for them to contact, okay?</i>

1984
02:23:25,250 --> 02:23:26,375
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1985
02:23:26,583 --> 02:23:28,166
<i>If they contact right now,</i>

1986
02:23:28,166 --> 02:23:31,916
<i>maybe you're gonna, you know,
celebrate your Sabbath with your family.</i>

1987
02:23:34,833 --> 02:23:35,958
<i>- Hello.
- Okay.</i>

1988
02:23:37,166 --> 02:23:38,291
<i>You killed one?</i>

1989
02:23:38,625 --> 02:23:40,333
<i>No, both...</i>

1990
02:23:41,208 --> 02:23:42,625
<i>Give them an ultimatum!</i>

1991
02:23:42,625 --> 02:23:44,458
<i>This is just the trailer.</i>

1992
02:23:44,750 --> 02:23:46,625
<i>The whole movie is yet to come.</i>

1993
02:23:46,625 --> 02:23:49,291
<i>They should know this
is just the trailer.</i>

1994
02:23:49,416 --> 02:23:51,208
<i>The whole movie is yet to come.</i>

1995
02:23:55,666 --> 02:23:57,833
<i>We passed on the intel.</i>

1996
02:23:59,166 --> 02:24:01,458
<i>Got it there before time.</i>

1997
02:24:02,541 --> 02:24:04,166
Then how the hell did this happen?

1998
02:24:06,916 --> 02:24:09,041
- We told them about 3rd October.
- Oh, come on!

1999
02:24:11,333 --> 02:24:12,625
We never told them about 26th November.

2000
02:24:14,916 --> 02:24:20,416
On that day, the intelligence department
received 309 different threat alerts.

2001
02:24:21,416 --> 02:24:24,041
Cochin, Manipur, Samba,
Delhi, Jaipur, Somnath!

2002
02:24:24,583 --> 02:24:26,333
Some real, most wrong.

2003
02:24:29,416 --> 02:24:30,500
The one they caught.

2004
02:24:31,541 --> 02:24:33,208
Ajmal Kasab...

2005
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,041
I'm the one who put a gun in his hands.

2006
02:24:43,708 --> 02:24:48,166
They walked straight...

2007
02:24:50,541 --> 02:24:52,666
into my home in broad daylight!

2008
02:24:58,416 --> 02:24:59,416
Iqbal,

2009
02:25:00,791 --> 02:25:01,666
Khanani,

2010
02:25:02,666 --> 02:25:03,750
Mir,

2011
02:25:04,375 --> 02:25:05,458
Bhuttovi.

2012
02:25:06,375 --> 02:25:08,125
I'll finish every last one of them.

2013
02:25:09,541 --> 02:25:11,958
<i>Revenge burns hot, Hamza.</i>

2014
02:25:12,416 --> 02:25:13,708
It'll torch your neighbor's house,

2015
02:25:13,708 --> 02:25:16,000
but the flames will always cross
your own courtyard.

2016
02:25:16,750 --> 02:25:19,958
One wrong move and you go down.

2017
02:25:20,666 --> 02:25:23,791
If even one of our assets gets
caught across the border,

2018
02:25:25,625 --> 02:25:28,791
India's reputation will crumble into dust.

2019
02:25:32,125 --> 02:25:33,875
You'll get your revenge.

2020
02:25:38,125 --> 02:25:39,041
Be patient.

2021
02:25:41,291 --> 02:25:43,250
We're in this game to win.

2022
02:25:44,166 --> 02:25:46,583
And to win, there's only one rule...

2023
02:25:46,916 --> 02:25:48,333
For us to stay alive.

2024
02:25:54,791 --> 02:25:55,708
Here...

2025
02:26:16,625 --> 02:26:17,791
{\an8}A wounded lion doesn't fear death.

2026
02:26:19,791 --> 02:26:21,208
{\an8}It just makes him more lethal.

2027
02:26:43,375 --> 02:26:44,375
Where were you all night?

2028
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:46,916
Where were you?!

2029
02:26:48,541 --> 02:26:51,458
I'm sick of waiting for you
in this pigeonhole!

2030
02:26:53,750 --> 02:26:55,458
Hamza, I'm talking to you!
Answer me!

2031
02:26:55,458 --> 02:26:57,583
I left my father's home for you!

2032
02:27:02,208 --> 02:27:03,250
Are you drunk?

2033
02:27:04,708 --> 02:27:05,708
Who were you with?

2034
02:27:07,333 --> 02:27:08,375
Some girl?

2035
02:27:10,291 --> 02:27:11,541
Were you with her all night?

2036
02:27:13,875 --> 02:27:15,250
Hamza, answer me!

2037
02:27:15,250 --> 02:27:17,458
Did you spend the night with her?
Who is she?

2038
02:27:17,958 --> 02:27:19,791
Who is she?
Who were you with, Hamza?

2039
02:27:19,791 --> 02:27:20,875
Answer me!

2040
02:27:53,250 --> 02:27:56,250
I want to be the undisputed king
of Karachi.

2041
02:27:58,791 --> 02:27:59,875
If you can walk beside me,

2042
02:27:59,875 --> 02:28:02,416
you'll have every right to me
as long as I live.

2043
02:28:04,083 --> 02:28:05,333
But hereafter...

2044
02:28:06,708 --> 02:28:08,416
there will be no more questions.

2045
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:11,958
If you can't do that,

2046
02:28:13,833 --> 02:28:15,333
the door's right there.

2047
02:29:16,791 --> 02:29:17,750
Hereafter,

2048
02:29:18,666 --> 02:29:21,375
if you ever ask me to leave again,

2049
02:29:24,416 --> 02:29:26,541
I'll burn you alive in your sleep.

2050
02:29:42,875 --> 02:29:44,166
PEOPLE'S DECISION
PAKISTAN AWAMI PARTY

2051
02:29:44,166 --> 02:29:46,333
My brothers of Lyari,

2052
02:29:47,375 --> 02:29:49,583
seeing this kind of energy today,

2053
02:29:50,208 --> 02:29:55,500
{\an8}my late wife Benazir's soul
must be smiling.

2054
02:29:59,458 --> 02:30:03,083
Our opposition may have forgotten,

2055
02:30:03,250 --> 02:30:04,833
but once upon a time,

2056
02:30:05,208 --> 02:30:07,333
Lyari voted for me too,

2057
02:30:07,500 --> 02:30:10,541
just like you voted for Jameel <i>sahab,</i>

2058
02:30:10,541 --> 02:30:13,166
and made me the MNA
of this very place.

2059
02:30:15,958 --> 02:30:19,875
That's why today,
I'm thrilled to announce...

2060
02:30:20,416 --> 02:30:23,875
That in the upcoming election,

2061
02:30:24,625 --> 02:30:26,250
representing PAP...

2062
02:30:26,541 --> 02:30:28,416
my younger brother...

2063
02:30:28,958 --> 02:30:31,125
Rehman Baloch's party,

2064
02:30:31,750 --> 02:30:36,083
the People's Aman Committee
will fight in alliance with us!

2065
02:30:36,875 --> 02:30:39,500
<i>Come to me, come here</i>

2066
02:30:40,833 --> 02:30:44,666
<i>Come to me, come here
Oh, my beloved</i>

2067
02:30:44,666 --> 02:30:48,541
<i>Come to me, come here</i>

2068
02:30:56,541 --> 02:30:58,416
<i>Come to me, come here</i>

2069
02:30:58,666 --> 02:31:00,416
<i>Hold me tight, my dear</i>

2070
02:31:00,416 --> 02:31:04,291
<i>Oh, my beloved
You have stolen my heart away</i>

2071
02:31:04,416 --> 02:31:08,208
<i>Oh, my beloved
My eyes yearn for you</i>

2072
02:31:08,375 --> 02:31:11,291
<i>All my faith has shattered
And been swept away too</i>

2073
02:31:11,291 --> 02:31:13,625
<i>You have stolen my heart away</i>

2074
02:31:15,208 --> 02:31:17,458
<i>You have stolen my heart away</i>

2075
02:31:19,166 --> 02:31:21,500
<i>You have stolen my heart away</i>

2076
02:31:23,458 --> 02:31:25,708
<i>As-salam alaykum,</i> Lyari!

2077
02:31:38,166 --> 02:31:39,916
Right after my duty to God,

2078
02:31:41,625 --> 02:31:45,916
my greatest duty is to honor Lyari.

2079
02:31:47,083 --> 02:31:48,458
And for that honor,

2080
02:31:49,333 --> 02:31:51,833
if I ever have to place
my head on a platter,

2081
02:31:52,833 --> 02:31:55,000
I'll gladly offer it.

2082
02:32:00,375 --> 02:32:01,458
In return for the respect Zarwari sir

2083
02:32:03,041 --> 02:32:07,583
showed me by calling me
his younger brother,

2084
02:32:08,458 --> 02:32:10,750
my party, the People's Aman Committee,

2085
02:32:11,875 --> 02:32:13,416
promises you this.

2086
02:32:13,916 --> 02:32:15,375
We will stand with PAP...

2087
02:32:16,250 --> 02:32:18,083
till the end of time!

2088
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:25,625
The leader of Pakistan, Atif Ali Zarwari!

2089
02:32:25,750 --> 02:32:29,291
The leader of Pakistan, Atif Ali Zarwari!

2090
02:32:29,291 --> 02:32:32,916
The leader of Pakistan,
Atif Ali Zarwari!

2091
02:32:32,916 --> 02:32:35,708
The leader of Pakistan, Atif Ali Zarwari!

2092
02:32:35,708 --> 02:32:38,375
- The cry of Takbir...
- Allah is the greatest!

2093
02:32:41,750 --> 02:32:43,750
What will a true messiah
of our community be like?

2094
02:32:43,750 --> 02:32:45,916
He will be like Rehman Baloch!

2095
02:32:45,916 --> 02:32:47,958
What will a true messiah
of our community be like?

2096
02:32:47,958 --> 02:32:50,333
He will be like Rehman Baloch!

2097
02:33:17,125 --> 02:33:19,375
{\an8}<i>You have stolen my heart away</i>

2098
02:33:20,791 --> 02:33:23,208
<i>You have stolen my heart away</i>

2099
02:33:24,750 --> 02:33:27,208
<i>You have stolen my heart away</i>

2100
02:33:28,666 --> 02:33:31,208
<i>You have stolen my heart away</i>

2101
02:33:33,541 --> 02:33:35,458
<i>Come to me, come here</i>

2102
02:33:38,500 --> 02:33:41,208
<i>Lyari's political scene
is shifting once again.</i>

2103
02:33:41,208 --> 02:33:43,875
{\an8}<i>Today, in a surprising move,</i>

2104
02:33:43,875 --> 02:33:46,750
<i>Pakistan's President
Atif Ali Zarwari announced that</i>

2105
02:33:46,750 --> 02:33:48,750
<i>his Pakistan Awami Party will contest</i>

2106
02:33:48,750 --> 02:33:51,166
<i>the next election alongside
Rehman Baloch's new party,</i>

2107
02:33:51,166 --> 02:33:53,541
{\an8}<i>the People's Aman Committee.</i>

2108
02:33:53,958 --> 02:33:55,875
<i>With this, Rehman Baloch,</i>

2109
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,041
<i>known across Lyari as its savior,</i>

2110
02:33:58,166 --> 02:34:00,166
<i>is officially stepping
into politics.</i>

2111
02:34:03,291 --> 02:34:04,208
Darn it!

2112
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:16,333
<i>According to political analysts,</i>

2113
02:34:16,333 --> 02:34:18,250
<i>Rehman's entering the fray
raises serious doubts</i>

2114
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:21,541
<i>about Jameel Jamali's
political future.</i>

2115
02:34:22,041 --> 02:34:23,333
<i>Zarwari sahab's decision
could completely reshape</i>

2116
02:34:23,333 --> 02:34:25,708
<i>the face of Pakistani politics.</i>

2117
02:34:26,250 --> 02:34:27,875
<i>Lyari, once known only
for mafias and gangs...</i>

2118
02:34:27,875 --> 02:34:30,250
Dad's whole life is about
to fall apart.

2119
02:34:30,708 --> 02:34:32,875
With the crimes he's stacked up,
this was inevitable.

2120
02:34:37,625 --> 02:34:40,708
Your dad's sins are
nothing next to mine.

2121
02:34:42,958 --> 02:34:44,916
You don't know my dad.

2122
02:34:45,666 --> 02:34:48,291
If he could,
he'd sell all of Karachi in a heartbeat.

2123
02:34:50,500 --> 02:34:51,875
Invite him for tea tomorrow.

2124
02:34:55,041 --> 02:34:55,916
Here?

2125
02:35:18,250 --> 02:35:20,416
If you'd actually done
your duty as a father,

2126
02:35:22,041 --> 02:35:23,791
your daughter wouldn't be
sitting in my house today.

2127
02:35:27,583 --> 02:35:29,208
And now some rookie

2128
02:35:29,833 --> 02:35:31,166
thinks he can school me?!

2129
02:35:35,583 --> 02:35:39,375
She's 19, and you must be around 30-32?

2130
02:35:40,500 --> 02:35:42,916
Have a little shame, you bastard.

2131
02:35:43,708 --> 02:35:45,208
Just cause you managed
to sweet-talk a kid,

2132
02:35:45,416 --> 02:35:47,333
you think you're some hero?

2133
02:35:48,791 --> 02:35:51,250
I was already running the streets
when your mom was

2134
02:35:51,875 --> 02:35:54,333
still wiping your ass.

2135
02:35:55,541 --> 02:35:57,125
Remember this,

2136
02:35:58,541 --> 02:36:00,291
my blood echoes through all of Lyari,

2137
02:36:01,458 --> 02:36:03,125
you useless piece of...

2138
02:36:04,791 --> 02:36:06,583
He wants to lecture me on
what a father's duty is!

2139
02:36:07,666 --> 02:36:09,291
To save your political position,

2140
02:36:09,291 --> 02:36:11,541
sometimes you leaned on Rehman,

2141
02:36:13,125 --> 02:36:14,666
sometimes on SP Aslam.

2142
02:36:15,916 --> 02:36:17,083
And these days you've got that

2143
02:36:17,083 --> 02:36:18,750
snake, Arshad Pappu, coiled
around your neck.

2144
02:36:20,416 --> 02:36:22,208
You've always propped up people

2145
02:36:22,208 --> 02:36:26,291
who could crush you
the moment they get stronger

2146
02:36:26,291 --> 02:36:28,250
and snatch Lyari right
out of your hands.

2147
02:36:29,666 --> 02:36:31,750
If you really want to hold on to Lyari,

2148
02:36:32,625 --> 02:36:35,916
don't bet on Rehman,
don't bet on Arshad.

2149
02:36:37,250 --> 02:36:38,500
Choose someone who's close.

2150
02:36:40,750 --> 02:36:42,500
Someone loyal.

2151
02:36:47,791 --> 02:36:48,958
Someone related to you.

2152
02:36:50,333 --> 02:36:51,875
Someone who's family.

2153
02:36:56,083 --> 02:36:57,583
Think about it, Jameel <i>sahab...</i>

2154
02:36:59,791 --> 02:37:01,416
This advice is straight-up fire.

2155
02:37:15,916 --> 02:37:18,708
<i>Fine, Lyari is yours for the taking.</i>

2156
02:38:14,416 --> 02:38:18,083
<i>You lifted the veil</i>

2157
02:38:18,833 --> 02:38:24,291
<i>And all went astray</i>

2158
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:29,125
<i>A small meeting</i>

2159
02:38:29,333 --> 02:38:34,666
<i>Turned into wild incident today</i>

2160
02:38:35,583 --> 02:38:37,791
<i>Our eyes met</i>

2161
02:38:37,791 --> 02:38:43,791
<i>Just me and you</i>

2162
02:38:44,666 --> 02:38:48,791
<i>Night became day</i>

2163
02:38:48,791 --> 02:38:55,125
<i>Then night once again came through</i>

2164
02:39:09,958 --> 02:39:13,416
<i>I'm a delicate flower
With an innocent face</i>

2165
02:39:13,708 --> 02:39:17,125
<i>A golden heart and intentions
Full of grace</i>

2166
02:39:17,291 --> 02:39:21,000
<i>I'm a delicate flower
With an innocent face</i>

2167
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:24,666
<i>A golden heart and intentions
Full of grace</i>

2168
02:39:24,666 --> 02:39:28,000
<i>No one knows what I hide behind this veil</i>

2169
02:39:28,375 --> 02:39:31,208
<i>No one knows the secrets in my tale</i>

2170
02:39:31,208 --> 02:39:35,500
<i>Let me show you how addictive I can be</i>

2171
02:39:35,500 --> 02:39:38,625
<i>Let me show you how to be naughty</i>

2172
02:39:38,625 --> 02:39:41,541
<i>When my eyes meet yours fearlessly</i>

2173
02:39:42,916 --> 02:39:45,916
<i>Let me show you how to be naughty</i>

2174
02:39:45,916 --> 02:39:49,125
<i>When my eyes meet yours fearlessly</i>

2175
02:39:56,833 --> 02:39:59,750
My dear, you've become especially
favored by Zarwari <i>sahab.</i>

2176
02:40:00,125 --> 02:40:04,375
All thanks to your recommendation
after the 26/11 incident.

2177
02:40:04,750 --> 02:40:07,875
<i>You're alone, and I'm the same</i>

2178
02:40:07,875 --> 02:40:11,958
<i>When we come together
We are a blazing flame</i>

2179
02:40:12,125 --> 02:40:15,250
<i>You're handsome
I'm romantic in my own way</i>

2180
02:40:15,250 --> 02:40:19,583
<i>When night falls, our masks fade away</i>

2181
02:40:19,583 --> 02:40:22,958
<i>My lips are painted like a rose so fine</i>

2182
02:40:23,333 --> 02:40:26,416
<i>My lips are painted like a rose so fine</i>

2183
02:40:26,416 --> 02:40:30,208
<i>Let me offer a sweetness that feels divine</i>

2184
02:40:30,666 --> 02:40:33,583
<i>Let me show you how to be naughty</i>

2185
02:40:33,583 --> 02:40:36,958
<i>When my eyes meet yours fearlessly</i>

2186
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,875
<i>Let me show you how to be naughty</i>

2187
02:40:40,875 --> 02:40:44,625
<i>When my eyes meet yours fearlessly</i>

2188
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,625
If India pulled this on us,

2189
02:41:10,958 --> 02:41:12,291
I swear to God
I'd march straight into Delhi

2190
02:41:12,291 --> 02:41:13,541
and butcher every one
of those guys.

2191
02:41:13,541 --> 02:41:15,500
Everything alright, guys?
All good? Need anything?

2192
02:41:15,625 --> 02:41:17,166
It's your wedding.

2193
02:41:17,166 --> 02:41:18,416
Go enjoy yourself.

2194
02:41:19,208 --> 02:41:22,250
- Go make some babies.
- Indeed.

2195
02:41:22,541 --> 02:41:24,833
Come, Hamza, sit with us.

2196
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:27,458
We were just saying,

2197
02:41:27,458 --> 02:41:32,833
after 26/11, we really thought India
would strike back.

2198
02:41:33,333 --> 02:41:35,666
But they turned out
to be cowards.

2199
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:38,041
Congratulations on the wedding.

2200
02:41:38,166 --> 02:41:41,458
Those Indians kept whining
to America,

2201
02:41:41,916 --> 02:41:43,708
and America kept dangling
a carrot in front of them.

2202
02:41:44,708 --> 02:41:45,875
A carrot!

2203
02:41:47,458 --> 02:41:50,333
ISI thinks that, along with Kashmir,

2204
02:41:50,333 --> 02:41:53,458
we should spark the
Punjab movement again.

2205
02:41:56,208 --> 02:41:58,416
So they have requested something
Mumbai-style

2206
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:02,291
to go down in Amritsar
on 15th August.

2207
02:42:07,291 --> 02:42:11,458
I'm always ready to serve ISI, <i>bhai.</i>

2208
02:42:12,333 --> 02:42:13,791
Send the list to Uzair.

2209
02:42:15,083 --> 02:42:16,833
The goods will reach
ahead of schedule.

2210
02:42:18,041 --> 02:42:19,125
That's great.

2211
02:42:20,708 --> 02:42:24,166
If Rehman <i>bhai</i> has said it,
it's as good as done.

2212
02:42:24,166 --> 02:42:25,541
Hey, check the date.

2213
02:42:38,208 --> 02:42:40,666
Wait, doofus, I'll grab it.

2214
02:42:52,250 --> 02:42:53,791
Look properly. Check it.

2215
02:42:59,541 --> 02:43:01,375
What about 9th August?
You're free that day.

2216
02:43:02,750 --> 02:43:03,666
You can speak to Shirani <i>sahab</i>

2217
02:43:03,666 --> 02:43:05,125
and get the arms
and ammo sorted for that date.

2218
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,666
{\an8}You'll receive everything
on the night of 9th August.

2219
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:10,958
{\an8}Perfect.

2220
02:43:17,458 --> 02:43:21,458
Rehman <i>bhai,</i>
how about a group photo?

2221
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:29,375
- Come on, get up, if you can...
<i>- My friend's getting married today</i>

2222
02:43:29,541 --> 02:43:33,541
<i>My friend's getting married today</i>

2223
02:43:33,541 --> 02:43:35,000
Come on.

2224
02:43:36,208 --> 02:43:37,875
A man standing six
and a half feet tall...

2225
02:43:37,875 --> 02:43:40,666
Smile, sir, it's your first wedding.

2226
02:43:40,666 --> 02:43:43,166
Cut it out, uncle,
or I'll get your mother remarried.

2227
02:44:37,750 --> 02:44:41,625
<i>I'm always ready to serve ISI,</i> bhai.

2228
02:44:41,625 --> 02:44:47,166
<i>Lovers are meant to promise and stay</i>

2229
02:44:52,125 --> 02:44:54,833
<i>But the one who leaves has a price to pay</i>

2230
02:44:57,333 --> 02:45:00,000
<i>You showed me brightness
Then left me in ache</i>

2231
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:01,500
<i>Pulled out my soul like
It was yours to take</i>

2232
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:02,625
<i>You left me in ache</i>

2233
02:45:02,625 --> 02:45:05,083
<i>Then you pulled out my soul like
It was yours to take</i>

2234
02:45:20,875 --> 02:45:22,916
<i>Your promises ruined me, my dear</i>

2235
02:45:23,041 --> 02:45:25,958
<i>Tell me what love gave me here?</i>

2236
02:45:25,958 --> 02:45:28,250
<i>Your promises ruined me, my dear</i>

2237
02:45:28,916 --> 02:45:31,041
<i>Your promises ruined me, my dear</i>

2238
02:45:31,250 --> 02:45:36,375
<i>You played those lover eyes
From the winning lane</i>

2239
02:45:36,375 --> 02:45:41,625
<i>You walked off winning
While I lost the game</i>

2240
02:45:41,625 --> 02:45:44,166
<i>Your weak heart suddenly learned to roar</i>

2241
02:45:44,166 --> 02:45:47,125
<i>That's why you turned your face
And closed the door</i>

2242
02:45:47,125 --> 02:45:48,875
<i>- As-salam alaykum,</i> Shirani <i>sahab.
- Wa'alaykumu...</i>

2243
02:45:49,833 --> 02:45:50,708
Rehman?

2244
02:45:51,208 --> 02:45:53,666
He got tied up with some political work,
so he sent me in his place.

2245
02:45:55,666 --> 02:45:57,083
Here's the list for the new lot.

2246
02:45:58,916 --> 02:46:01,000
We need more guns this time.

2247
02:46:01,541 --> 02:46:02,583
When do you want them?

2248
02:46:03,041 --> 02:46:05,166
By 9th August, at 3 o'clock.

2249
02:46:06,250 --> 02:46:08,208
Uzair will meet you
at the Kotri border.

2250
02:46:08,916 --> 02:46:11,750
Let me know if you've got any questions
about anything on this list.

2251
02:46:12,250 --> 02:46:15,375
Rehman <i>bhai's</i> swamped these days,
so he's handed this job over to me.

2252
02:46:24,583 --> 02:46:26,708
We've already lost 63 kids.

2253
02:46:29,083 --> 02:46:31,833
Yesterday, ISI poisoned
the school's water supply.

2254
02:46:34,250 --> 02:46:36,166
<i>Your promises ruined me, my dear</i>

2255
02:46:36,375 --> 02:46:39,291
<i>Tell me what love gave me here?</i>

2256
02:46:39,291 --> 02:46:41,625
<i>Your promises ruined me, my dear</i>

2257
02:46:41,625 --> 02:46:44,583
<i>Tell me what love gave me here?</i>

2258
02:46:44,583 --> 02:46:49,166
<i>Your promises ruined me, my dear</i>

2259
02:46:56,083 --> 02:46:58,916
Nice work, Rehman <i>bhai,</i>
cutting the ribbon and all that!

2260
02:47:00,291 --> 02:47:07,083
{\an8}<i>Do something that people
Turn this into a song</i>

2261
02:47:10,708 --> 02:47:15,583
{\an8}<i>Don't push me away, darling
I'm not that strong</i>

2262
02:47:15,583 --> 02:47:18,541
<i>Your leaving cut me, tore my soul apart</i>

2263
02:47:18,541 --> 02:47:23,708
<i>Left me crazy with an empty heart</i>

2264
02:47:23,708 --> 02:47:25,916
<i>Your promises ruined me, my dear</i>

2265
02:47:26,416 --> 02:47:28,541
<i>Your promises ruined me, my dear</i>

2266
02:47:28,541 --> 02:47:31,541
<i>Tell me what love gave me here?</i>

2267
02:47:31,541 --> 02:47:33,833
<i>Your promises ruined me, my dear</i>

2268
02:47:41,208 --> 02:47:42,916
<i>Salam alaykum,</i> Shirani <i>sahab.</i>
All well?

2269
02:47:44,208 --> 02:47:45,083
What?

2270
02:47:46,291 --> 02:47:47,875
I had no clue.

2271
02:47:48,458 --> 02:47:49,666
No, it's fine, not an issue.

2272
02:47:49,666 --> 02:47:52,666
I'll talk to Rehman <i>bhai.</i>

2273
02:47:53,416 --> 02:47:54,333
What's going on?

2274
02:47:54,708 --> 02:47:57,250
Shirani <i>sahab</i> is already at
the Kotri border with the ammo.

2275
02:47:58,416 --> 02:48:00,583
I didn't even know the delivery
was scheduled for today.

2276
02:48:01,041 --> 02:48:02,958
<i>Bhai</i> fixed the date himself
on the same day as my wedding reception.

2277
02:48:04,125 --> 02:48:05,708
It's okay, I'll go get it.
You stay with <i>bhai.</i>

2278
02:48:05,708 --> 02:48:07,833
No, no, let me go,
it's no biggie.

2279
02:48:08,666 --> 02:48:10,000
You stay with Rehman <i>bhai.</i>

2280
02:48:10,541 --> 02:48:14,291
Anyway, I find this political
drama quite ridiculous.

2281
02:48:14,458 --> 02:48:15,375
- Stay in touch.
- Yeah.

2282
02:48:15,375 --> 02:48:16,916
I'll call once I have the goods.

2283
02:48:17,708 --> 02:48:18,625
Hand me the car keys.

2284
02:49:34,250 --> 02:49:36,750
Whatever needs to be done has
to be done before we enter Lyari.

2285
02:49:39,916 --> 02:49:40,958
Once he crosses into Lyari,

2286
02:49:40,958 --> 02:49:42,791
you won't be able
to lay a finger on Rehman.

2287
02:49:43,666 --> 02:49:44,875
The best spot for it?

2288
02:49:46,416 --> 02:49:48,125
<i>That forest stretch
near Circular Road.</i>

2289
02:50:01,750 --> 02:50:02,833
Why are we taking this route?

2290
02:50:06,291 --> 02:50:07,791
There's bridge construction
going on at Dastan,

2291
02:50:07,791 --> 02:50:09,000
and traffic's backed up like crazy.

2292
02:50:12,916 --> 02:50:14,291
Where are Rasal and Saukat?

2293
02:50:14,541 --> 02:50:16,333
Stuck at the Kasim Park signal.

2294
02:50:16,333 --> 02:50:17,791
They'll join us
on the Lyari Expressway.

2295
02:50:26,583 --> 02:50:27,708
Where's Uzair?

2296
02:50:28,125 --> 02:50:29,416
He's gone to Kotri, <i>bhai,</i>

2297
02:50:29,958 --> 02:50:31,916
to pick up the ammunition
shipment for Amritsar.

2298
02:50:32,791 --> 02:50:34,583
I was supposed to inaugurate
the pipeline today.

2299
02:50:35,625 --> 02:50:37,791
This date was fixed on the day
of my wedding reception.

2300
02:50:39,416 --> 02:50:40,333
I suggested it?

2301
02:50:40,583 --> 02:50:41,833
Yes, <i>bhai.</i>

2302
02:50:42,833 --> 02:50:44,833
Anyway, Uzair should be
on his way back.

2303
02:50:44,833 --> 02:50:46,333
Another two to three hours
and he should be here.

2304
02:50:48,750 --> 02:50:50,041
<i>Hey, check the date.</i>

2305
02:50:50,625 --> 02:50:52,041
<i>What about 9th August?</i>

2306
02:50:52,416 --> 02:50:53,333
<i>You're free that day.</i>

2307
02:50:55,875 --> 02:50:56,833
Pull over.

2308
02:50:58,208 --> 02:50:59,166
I gotta empty the tank.

2309
02:51:01,916 --> 02:51:03,000
It's not safe here.

2310
02:51:03,166 --> 02:51:06,625
Hold it in for another
half kilometer.

2311
02:51:29,625 --> 02:51:31,750
<i>I wouldn't trust this Baloch
for a second.</i>

2312
02:51:32,250 --> 02:51:34,625
The only reason he's still alive is...

2313
02:51:35,666 --> 02:51:36,833
because I allow it.

2314
02:51:37,041 --> 02:51:39,791
Sure, he's a Baloch,
but he's also my son-in-law now.

2315
02:51:39,958 --> 02:51:41,208
Understand one thing.

2316
02:51:41,750 --> 02:51:43,583
The day he sits on Lyari's throne,

2317
02:51:43,833 --> 02:51:46,041
the reins of Karachi fall
into our hands.

2318
02:51:46,416 --> 02:51:48,125
And once you've got
Karachi by the reins...

2319
02:51:48,541 --> 02:51:50,708
You can ride all of Pakistan.

2320
02:51:50,958 --> 02:51:52,541
Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop.

2321
02:52:03,833 --> 02:52:04,708
Hamza...

2322
02:52:05,375 --> 02:52:06,250
Yes, <i>bhai?</i>

2323
02:52:06,250 --> 02:52:08,125
<i>- Don't hand your heart to a stranger, dear</i>
- Stop the car.

2324
02:52:08,125 --> 02:52:10,500
<i>- Or every day you'll have to shed tears</i>
- Listen, Baloch,

2325
02:52:11,666 --> 02:52:13,958
if you double-cross me,

2326
02:52:15,083 --> 02:52:17,833
I will pimp you out before I kill you!

2327
02:52:20,291 --> 02:52:21,291
And Jameel <i>sahab,</i>

2328
02:52:22,541 --> 02:52:23,583
I'll personally castrate you.

2329
02:52:23,583 --> 02:52:25,500
<i>These fresh love-wounds
Still burning through</i>

2330
02:52:25,500 --> 02:52:27,666
<i>I'll stitch them shut, with a smile too</i>

2331
02:52:27,666 --> 02:52:29,083
<i>And if my lover hands me poison to take...</i>

2332
02:52:29,083 --> 02:52:30,416
Stop the car.

2333
02:52:31,375 --> 02:52:32,416
<i>Dhurandhar!</i>

2334
02:52:32,750 --> 02:52:34,291
<i>I'm a king, but I'm far from a saint</i>

2335
02:52:34,291 --> 02:52:35,416
<i>They call me a bad man</i>

2336
02:52:35,416 --> 02:52:36,500
<i>That's a fucking good thing</i>

2337
02:52:36,500 --> 02:52:38,500
<i>Mama said swing back
When another man swings...</i>

2338
02:52:38,500 --> 02:52:39,833
Stop the car right now!

2339
02:52:39,833 --> 02:52:40,833
Rehman <i>bhai?</i>

2340
02:52:41,250 --> 02:52:43,125
<i>Father, forgive me
I can't forgive them</i>

2341
02:52:43,125 --> 02:52:44,333
Stop the car right now!

2342
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:46,416
- What happened, <i>bhai?</i>
- He's a traitor!

2343
02:52:46,416 --> 02:52:47,708
He's teamed up with the SP!

2344
02:52:47,708 --> 02:52:49,583
Hamza, hit the brakes!

2345
02:52:49,583 --> 02:52:51,916
- Stop the car right now!
<i>- Don't hand your heart to a stranger, dear</i>

2346
02:52:51,916 --> 02:52:54,083
<i>Or every day you'll have to shed tears</i>

2347
02:52:54,291 --> 02:52:56,000
<i>If you choose a saint to stay beside</i>

2348
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:57,958
<i>You'll have to walk
That saintly path in stride</i>

2349
02:52:57,958 --> 02:52:59,083
Pull over right now!

2350
02:52:59,083 --> 02:53:00,750
<i>These fresh love-wounds
Still burning through</i>

2351
02:53:00,750 --> 02:53:02,708
<i>I'll stitch them shut, with a smile too</i>

2352
02:53:02,708 --> 02:53:05,458
<i>And if my lover hands me poison to take...</i>

2353
02:53:06,333 --> 02:53:07,833
<i>Dhurandhar!</i>

2354
02:53:08,583 --> 02:53:09,458
Stop...

2355
02:53:10,625 --> 02:53:12,208
<i>Dhurandhar!</i>

2356
02:53:16,125 --> 02:53:17,916
<i>Don't hand your heart to a stranger, dear</i>

2357
02:53:17,916 --> 02:53:20,291
<i>- Or every day you'll have to shed tears</i>
- You dog, hit the brakes.

2358
02:53:20,291 --> 02:53:22,250
- Stop it.
<i>- If you choose a saint to stay beside</i>

2359
02:53:22,250 --> 02:53:24,666
<i>You'll have to walk
That saintly path in stride</i>

2360
02:53:24,666 --> 02:53:26,583
<i>These fresh love-wounds
Still burning through</i>

2361
02:53:26,583 --> 02:53:28,791
<i>I'll stitch them shut, with a smile too</i>

2362
02:53:28,791 --> 02:53:31,375
<i>And if my lover hands me poison to take...</i>

2363
02:53:32,458 --> 02:53:33,916
<i>Dhurandhar!</i>

2364
02:53:35,750 --> 02:53:36,875
Hold him down.

2365
02:53:36,875 --> 02:53:38,083
<i>Dhurandhar!</i>

2366
02:53:38,083 --> 02:53:39,958
{\an8}<i>Don't hand your heart</i>

2367
02:53:40,166 --> 02:53:41,125
<i>Don't...</i>

2368
02:53:41,125 --> 02:53:42,375
<i>Dhurandhar!</i>

2369
02:53:42,375 --> 02:53:44,375
<i>One and only calling out all the phonies</i>

2370
02:53:44,375 --> 02:53:46,583
<i>- Goat of 'em all
- Dhurandhar!</i>

2371
02:53:46,583 --> 02:53:48,833
<i>He's invincible, he's untouchable</i>

2372
02:53:48,833 --> 02:53:51,166
<i>- He's seen it all
- Dhurandhar!</i>

2373
02:53:51,166 --> 02:53:53,125
<i>One and only calling out all the phonies</i>

2374
02:53:53,125 --> 02:53:55,291
<i>- Goat of 'em all
- Dhurandhar!</i>

2375
02:53:55,291 --> 02:53:57,500
<i>He's invincible, he's untouchable</i>

2376
02:53:57,500 --> 02:53:58,666
<i>He's seen it all</i>

2377
02:53:59,916 --> 02:54:01,583
<i>I'm a king, but I'm far from a saint</i>

2378
02:54:01,583 --> 02:54:02,625
<i>They call me a bad man</i>

2379
02:54:02,625 --> 02:54:03,708
{\an8}<i>That's a good good thing</i>

2380
02:54:03,708 --> 02:54:05,958
<i>Mama said swing back
When another man swings</i>

2381
02:54:05,958 --> 02:54:08,375
<i>So I make mama proud
And make the hits rain</i>

2382
02:54:11,791 --> 02:54:14,666
<i>Heavy is the head</i>

2383
02:54:14,666 --> 02:54:16,083
<i>It's a blessing and a curse</i>

2384
02:54:16,083 --> 02:54:19,291
<i>Heavy is the head</i>

2385
02:54:19,291 --> 02:54:20,416
<i>I'm gonna make it worse</i>

2386
02:54:20,416 --> 02:54:23,625
<i>Heavy is the head</i>

2387
02:54:23,625 --> 02:54:24,875
<i>Hit 'em where it hurts</i>

2388
02:54:25,625 --> 02:54:27,208
<i>Dhurandhar!</i>

2389
02:55:13,583 --> 02:55:14,541
Donga, get up.

2390
02:55:15,416 --> 02:55:16,291
<i>Bhai!</i>

2391
02:55:20,041 --> 02:55:20,958
<i>Bhai!</i>

2392
02:55:20,958 --> 02:55:22,541
What happened? Who did this?

2393
02:55:22,916 --> 02:55:25,875
- Make sure he's dead.
- Okay, <i>bhai.</i>

2394
02:55:26,291 --> 02:55:28,333
- Finish him.
- Okay, <i>bhai.</i>

2395
02:55:28,625 --> 02:55:29,500
I won't spare him.

2396
02:55:29,791 --> 02:55:30,666
Wait, you...

2397
02:55:30,958 --> 02:55:32,375
<i>Bhai! Bhai,</i> SP!

2398
02:55:45,375 --> 02:55:47,750
Move, move, move! Guys, move forward!

2399
02:55:48,458 --> 02:55:49,791
On your right. On your right.

2400
02:55:53,166 --> 02:55:54,333
Take positions.

2401
02:55:55,250 --> 02:55:56,500
Hamza, you rascal!

2402
02:55:59,750 --> 02:56:01,333
Stop, you traitor. I won't spare you.

2403
02:56:04,500 --> 02:56:05,375
Stop!

2404
02:56:07,291 --> 02:56:08,291
Stop, you...

2405
02:56:10,791 --> 02:56:12,416
Surround them from the right side.

2406
02:56:37,625 --> 02:56:38,875
Get out of the car.

2407
02:56:45,916 --> 02:56:48,041
Step out of the car.

2408
02:57:12,208 --> 02:57:13,083
Donga?

2409
02:57:13,083 --> 02:57:14,083
Think you can take them?

2410
02:57:15,041 --> 02:57:16,125
I'll wipe them
off the face of the earth!

2411
02:57:20,541 --> 02:57:22,458
You're dead meat today!

2412
02:57:23,125 --> 02:57:24,083
Cover!

2413
02:57:26,250 --> 02:57:28,375
Come on! Come here,
and I'll teach you a lesson!

2414
02:57:36,291 --> 02:57:37,291
Stop, you rascal.

2415
02:57:38,375 --> 02:57:39,875
You can't escape me.

2416
02:57:42,500 --> 02:57:43,458
Come on! Come on!

2417
02:57:44,291 --> 02:57:46,791
Come on!
Come to daddy!

2418
02:57:52,833 --> 02:57:54,333
You traitor! Stop!

2419
02:57:57,625 --> 02:57:58,833
Take that, you bugger!

2420
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:30,458
Come out! I'll show you
what Donga really is!

2421
02:58:30,791 --> 02:58:33,291
Come on! Yes!

2422
03:00:02,666 --> 03:00:03,666
Come on!

2423
03:00:07,416 --> 03:00:09,208
Take that, you bugger!

2424
03:00:13,125 --> 03:00:15,125
This can't kill a Balochi!

2425
03:00:40,583 --> 03:00:41,750
Come to daddy!

2426
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:30,375
<i>Dhurandhar!</i>

2427
03:01:32,708 --> 03:01:34,125
<i>Dhurandhar!</i>

2428
03:01:36,125 --> 03:01:37,458
<i>Dhurandhar!</i>

2429
03:02:28,458 --> 03:02:29,958
Are you enjoying this, SP <i>sahab?</i>

2430
03:02:59,291 --> 03:03:00,791
I don't lose.

2431
03:03:15,666 --> 03:03:16,833
Die!

2432
03:03:17,750 --> 03:03:18,958
Just die already!

2433
03:04:12,208 --> 03:04:14,708
<i>- The cry of Takbir...
- Allah is the greatest!</i>

2434
03:04:55,416 --> 03:04:56,708
You enjoying this?

2435
03:05:01,125 --> 03:05:04,916
This is Rehman Dakait's blood, spill--

2436
03:05:10,625 --> 03:05:11,541
SP <i>sahab,</i>

2437
03:05:13,166 --> 03:05:14,166
whatever happens,

2438
03:05:15,916 --> 03:05:18,291
Rehman has to stay alive
till he reaches the city.

2439
03:05:19,166 --> 03:05:21,083
Shove your finger in the wound,

2440
03:05:21,750 --> 03:05:23,375
or he is going to bleed out.

2441
03:06:00,750 --> 03:06:02,750
Stop the car. I need your help.

2442
03:06:03,041 --> 03:06:04,250
Stop, stop you...

2443
03:06:06,750 --> 03:06:09,541
Stop the car. I need your help.

2444
03:06:09,833 --> 03:06:11,583
Stop, the damn car you...

2445
03:06:12,458 --> 03:06:13,333
You...

2446
03:06:14,666 --> 03:06:16,833
Hey, rickshaw!
Stop, you...

2447
03:06:16,958 --> 03:06:17,833
{\an8}Stop!

2448
03:06:19,333 --> 03:06:21,041
- I need help.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

2449
03:06:21,041 --> 03:06:22,000
He's been shot.

2450
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:22,958
- We have to get him to a hospital.
- Rehman <i>bhai?</i>

2451
03:06:23,750 --> 03:06:26,250
I heard you've been fooling around
with Shagufta lately.

2452
03:06:27,083 --> 03:06:28,208
He's with her every damn day.

2453
03:06:28,375 --> 03:06:29,541
She likes playing with my marbles as well.

2454
03:06:29,541 --> 03:06:30,708
Hold on, boys.

2455
03:06:32,375 --> 03:06:34,541
Hey, Hamza, we'll be there in a bit.

2456
03:06:34,541 --> 03:06:36,083
Uzair, get back right now.

2457
03:06:36,416 --> 03:06:38,166
LTF hit <i>bhai.</i> He's been shot.

2458
03:06:38,916 --> 03:06:39,875
<i>Come back immediately.</i>

2459
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:51,625
Look at me, <i>bhai.</i>
Don't shut your eyes.

2460
03:06:51,625 --> 03:06:53,375
Keep your eyes open,
keep breathing.

2461
03:06:54,333 --> 03:06:56,416
Stay with me...
yeah, that's it, that's it.

2462
03:06:57,375 --> 03:06:58,666
Keep your eyes--

2463
03:06:59,541 --> 03:07:00,416
<i>Bhai,</i> I'm right here.

2464
03:07:00,416 --> 03:07:01,541
You're going to be okay, <i>bhai.</i>

2465
03:07:04,125 --> 03:07:05,916
Keep your eyes open. Breathe,
<i>bhai,</i> breathe.

2466
03:07:06,583 --> 03:07:08,458
Don't shut them, <i>bhai.</i>
You'll be fine.

2467
03:07:08,458 --> 03:07:09,833
We won't let anything happen
to you, <i>bhai.</i>

2468
03:07:10,291 --> 03:07:11,458
Drive faster!

2469
03:07:11,458 --> 03:07:12,958
Yeah, yeah, I am!

2470
03:07:19,125 --> 03:07:20,583
We're almost there, <i>bhai.</i> Almost there.

2471
03:07:20,583 --> 03:07:21,958
Doctor!

2472
03:07:21,958 --> 03:07:23,458
Get out of my way!

2473
03:07:23,583 --> 03:07:24,500
Don't lose hope.

2474
03:07:24,500 --> 03:07:26,291
{\an8}You will be fine.
Keep your eyes open.

2475
03:07:26,291 --> 03:07:27,958
{\an8}- Hurry up, hurry up.
- We are here.

2476
03:07:27,958 --> 03:07:29,041
{\an8}Let's go. Hurry up.

2477
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,083
Go, go, go, get out of our way.

2478
03:07:33,250 --> 03:07:34,541
- Get out of our way.
- You will be fine.

2479
03:07:34,541 --> 03:07:36,166
Breathe, <i>bhai,</i> breathe.

2480
03:07:38,166 --> 03:07:40,458
Why aren't you prepared
for an emergency like this? Move!

2481
03:07:40,458 --> 03:07:42,875
- Take him inside now!
- Go, go, go!

2482
03:07:42,875 --> 03:07:46,916
- Move.
- Get out of our way!

2483
03:07:49,500 --> 03:07:50,375
Doctor...

2484
03:07:51,125 --> 03:07:53,083
Rehman <i>bhai,</i> keep breathing.

2485
03:07:53,791 --> 03:07:56,333
Open... open your eyes.

2486
03:08:05,958 --> 03:08:07,000
Doctor, he's...

2487
03:08:08,208 --> 03:08:09,083
You will be fine.

2488
03:09:01,416 --> 03:09:02,625
Rehman <i>bhai...</i>

2489
03:09:02,625 --> 03:09:05,625
Oh God, how could you let this happen?

2490
03:09:05,625 --> 03:09:06,916
Rehman <i>bhai...</i>

2491
03:09:06,916 --> 03:09:08,125
He was our messiah!

2492
03:09:08,125 --> 03:09:09,458
Rehman <i>bhai...</i>

2493
03:09:09,458 --> 03:09:10,791
How could this happen?

2494
03:09:33,875 --> 03:09:36,625
Covered in blood, he was running
with Rehman <i>bhai</i> on his shoulder.

2495
03:09:37,125 --> 03:09:40,125
Hamza <i>bhai</i>
did everything he could to save him.

2496
03:09:40,125 --> 03:09:41,708
But what Allah writes,
no one can rewrite...

2497
03:09:50,375 --> 03:10:04,333
As long as sun and moon remain,
Rehman, your name will still sustain.

2498
03:10:04,333 --> 03:10:06,166
As long as sun and moon remain...

2499
03:10:06,166 --> 03:10:08,416
<i>We've just received
word that the king of Lyari,</i>

2500
03:10:08,416 --> 03:10:09,458
<i>the savior of the poor,</i>

2501
03:10:09,458 --> 03:10:12,291
<i>Sher-e-Baloch,
Rehman Dakait, is no more.</i>

2502
03:10:12,916 --> 03:10:14,625
<i>According to sources,</i>

2503
03:10:14,625 --> 03:10:18,000
{\an8}<i>Rehman was returning
from a political meeting.</i>

2504
03:10:18,208 --> 03:10:20,041
<i>Near the jungle by Circular Road,</i>

2505
03:10:20,041 --> 03:10:23,500
<i>the LTF stopped his vehicle
and recovered weapons.</i>

2506
03:10:23,500 --> 03:10:25,166
<i>Before they could be questioned,</i>

2507
03:10:25,166 --> 03:10:30,125
<i>Rehman Dakait and his men opened fire
on SP Chaudhary Aslam and the LTF team.</i>

2508
03:10:30,250 --> 03:10:31,916
<i>Both sides exchanged heavy gunfire.</i>

2509
03:10:31,916 --> 03:10:35,208
<i>Most of Rehman's men
were killed in the crossfire.</i>

2510
03:10:35,416 --> 03:10:36,958
<i>Rehman Dakait was hit,</i>

2511
03:10:36,958 --> 03:10:39,541
<i>and by the time he was
rushed to Lyari General Hospital,</i>

2512
03:10:39,541 --> 03:10:42,000
<i>he had already lost
too much blood and died.</i>

2513
03:10:42,291 --> 03:10:45,000
{\an8}<i>Outside the hospital,
chaos has broken out.</i>

2514
03:10:45,166 --> 03:10:47,291
{\an8}<i>Public anger is at its peak.</i>

2515
03:10:47,541 --> 03:10:50,458
<i>People of Lyari want answers.</i>

2516
03:10:51,500 --> 03:10:52,375
Yeah.

2517
03:10:54,250 --> 03:10:55,291
Do you know who did it?

2518
03:11:24,791 --> 03:11:25,666
I'm hungry...

2519
03:11:26,458 --> 03:11:27,375
I'm starving.

2520
03:12:54,583 --> 03:12:59,916
2002

2521
03:13:21,750 --> 03:13:23,916
What is Operation Dhurandhar?

2522
03:13:24,916 --> 03:13:27,208
For the first time
in the history of espionage,

2523
03:13:27,833 --> 03:13:32,083
we'll send our own asset
to infiltrate the Pakistani underworld...

2524
03:13:32,791 --> 03:13:34,958
their mafia, their gangs.

2525
03:13:36,833 --> 03:13:39,375
It won't be easy
to get into Rehman Dakait's gang.

2526
03:13:39,750 --> 03:13:42,291
You might have to wait for a long time.

2527
03:13:42,291 --> 03:13:43,833
Is this my son's blood?

2528
03:13:43,958 --> 03:13:44,875
Yes.

2529
03:13:47,291 --> 03:13:48,750
In fact, evidence has shown

2530
03:13:49,625 --> 03:13:51,416
that directly or indirectly,

2531
03:13:51,750 --> 03:13:55,625
Pakistan has been involved in nearly
every major terror attack worldwide.

2532
03:13:59,208 --> 03:14:04,666
When the ISI sends
a terrorist organization to strike India,

2533
03:14:04,666 --> 03:14:07,000
where do they get their
weapons and ammunition?

2534
03:14:07,583 --> 03:14:08,583
From their own underworld.

2535
03:14:09,000 --> 03:14:12,958
Guns stamped "Made in Russia"
or "Made in America,"

2536
03:14:13,291 --> 03:14:14,208
not ours.

2537
03:14:14,458 --> 03:14:17,541
If an international investigation
happens tomorrow,

2538
03:14:17,541 --> 03:14:19,000
ISI's name must not appear anywhere.

2539
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:20,916
That's why, by infiltrating these gangs,

2540
03:14:21,666 --> 03:14:24,166
we'll get first-hand intelligence
on their mafia,

2541
03:14:24,708 --> 03:14:28,541
<i>their links with terrorists,
and the ISI's involvement.</i>

2542
03:14:30,041 --> 03:14:33,041
We're going to induct criminals
for this operation.

2543
03:14:33,458 --> 03:14:37,708
<i>Those who are either on death row
or serving life sentences.</i>

2544
03:14:38,250 --> 03:14:40,250
<i>People who have no purpose
left in their lives.</i>

2545
03:14:40,791 --> 03:14:42,958
<i>We'll give them a purpose.</i>

2546
03:14:43,416 --> 03:14:44,750
<i>And if we succeed,</i>

2547
03:14:44,916 --> 03:14:48,250
we might just have
a killing machine in our hands.

2548
03:15:17,125 --> 03:15:18,625
<i>There's a big back gangster on the loose</i>

2549
03:15:18,625 --> 03:15:21,041
<i>Thick skin, cold weather
Black leather, big news</i>

2550
03:15:21,041 --> 03:15:22,791
<i>There ain't nothing that a man can't do</i>

2551
03:15:22,791 --> 03:15:25,125
<i>So bring in the war
With blood we pay dues</i>

2552
03:15:25,125 --> 03:15:26,500
<i>There's a gangster, a gangster</i>

2553
03:15:26,500 --> 03:15:28,833
<i>Words he don't speak
But the danger will tame ya...</i>

2554
03:15:28,833 --> 03:15:29,833
{\an8}A wounded lion doesn't fear death.

2555
03:15:31,250 --> 03:15:32,458
{\an8}It just makes him more lethal.

2556
03:15:32,458 --> 03:15:35,541
<i>They tell me to accept
My destiny with grace</i>

2557
03:15:36,666 --> 03:15:40,250
{\an8}<i>Pressing poison into my hands
They urge me to swallow it</i>

2558
03:15:40,625 --> 03:15:44,833
{\an8}<i>They tell me to accept
My destiny with grace</i>

2559
03:15:44,833 --> 03:15:49,041
{\an8}<i>Pressing poison into my hands
They urge me to swallow it</i>

2560
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:53,083
<i>But once I drink it
They ask why I don't die</i>

2561
03:15:53,083 --> 03:15:57,583
<i>And when I'm dying
They say I must live</i>

2562

2563
03:16:23,166 --> 03:16:24,166

1

2565
03:16:45,458 --> 03:16:47,375
<i>He's a fight to the death</i>

2566
03:16:49,625 --> 03:16:51,541
<i>He's a gun to my head</i>

2567
03:16:53,791 --> 03:16:55,833
<i>An impossible friend</i>

2568
03:16:57,750 --> 03:16:59,708
<i>And put it all in one man</i>

2569
03:17:02,416 --> 03:17:03,916
<i>Men!</i>

2570
03:17:04,666 --> 03:17:05,541
<i>Check this out!</i>

2571
03:17:06,500 --> 03:17:08,041
<i>Men!</i>

2572
03:17:12,333 --> 03:17:14,083
<i>This is the new India.</i>

2573
03:17:14,500 --> 03:17:17,583
<i>We barge into your homes
and terminate you.</i>
