20
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:50,761
Hi, Millie!

21
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:53,286
Hi, Mrs. Winchester!

22
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:54,374
So nice to meet you.

23
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,723
Please call me Nina.

24
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:57,638
I've got some tea for us
and a charcuterie board.

25
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,205
Is it too early
for meat and cheese?

26
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:02,122
You know, that's what they have
for breakfast in Europe.

27
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:06,300
Wow, um,
you're just, this is...

28
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:09,693
I... I...

29
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:12,870
I'm just going to say,
I think you might be
overqualified for this job

30
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:14,916
with all this experience
and a college degree.

31
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,309
No, I know.

32
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,789
I just realized I really
enjoy being a housemaid.

33
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,964
You do?

34
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:21,837
For the right families,
of course.

35
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:26,188
Okay. What brought you back
to New York?

36
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,885
I missed it.

37
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:31,106
Well, I really love New England,
but I miss being in the city.

38
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:34,718
But you know this is
a live-in position, right?

39
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,633
I mentioned that in the ad,
didn't I?

40
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:38,157
Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.
No, of course. Yes. Yes.

41
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,767
Oh, God, okay.

42
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:41,508
I miss being near the city,

43
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:43,205
not actually in the city.

44
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:44,815
It's a little crazy.

45
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:48,123
Yes, I fully agree with you.

46
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:51,170
Okay, so the job is
mostly organizing, cleaning,

47
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,780
light cooking,
if you're up for that.

48
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:54,173
Oh, absolutely.
I love to cook.

49
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,652
Amazing.

50
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:57,045
And then you would be
helping me with my daughter.

51
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:59,526
She's Cecilia, Cece.

52
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:02,485
She's seven years old
and, well, she's amazing.

53
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:03,966
Well, I can't wait
to meet her.

54
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:06,794
Oh. Good. Okay.

55
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:08,622
Would you like a grand tour

56
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:10,450
so you can...

57
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,365
see what you're
getting yourself into?

58
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,670
Sure.

59
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:16,586
And the kitchen.

60
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:20,460
My husband, Andrew, designed
this entire house soup to nuts.

61
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:21,678
He's an architect?

62
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,071
No, he's in tech.

63
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:25,595
But he pays
incredible attention

64
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:27,031
to every detail.

65
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:30,731
Now, these steps are, uh,
kind of nuts, I know.

66
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:33,082
Andrew says I'm totally gonna
kill myself one day on these.

67
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,475
I'm such a klutz.

68
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:37,781
I should just draw
my chalk outline on the bottom

69
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:39,000
and get it over with.

70
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,088
So there's another set
of stairs

71
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:41,176
on the other side of the house

72
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:42,873
that are less Guggenheim-y.

73
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:44,224
If you're into that.

74
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:49,706
Wow.

75
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:51,752
It's basically
Andrew's man cave,

76
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:55,277
but you are welcome to use it
anytime you want, of course.

77
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:56,626
You'd be part of the family,

78
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:58,672
which also means
that you would definitely have

79
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:00,282
to listen to his TED Talk

80
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:04,200
about how Barry Lyndonis
a misunderstood masterpiece.

81
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,638
This is the upper living room,

82
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,293
which we barely ever use,
to be honest.

83
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:13,687
You sure you even need
a housekeeper?

84
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:16,429
Well, actually,
I'm... expecting.

85
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,518
So I'm not gonna have
quite so much time

86
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,476
to keep everything so perfect.

87
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:23,479
But don't tell Andrew
because it's very early

88
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,526
and I want to be sure,
you know, before I tell him.

89
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:28,005
Yeah. Congrats.

90
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:29,094
Thank you.

91
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:32,053
This is Cece's room.

92
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:33,359
Andrew even made a little

93
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,796
miniature version
of our house for her.

94
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:37,102
- Isn't that sweet?
- Wow.

95
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:45,675
So the laundry room is
in the basement,

96
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:48,374
and that would be
your bathroom

97
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,333
and you would be upstairs.

98
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,118
You're gonna think
it's a little bit small,

99
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,382
but it's got a lot of privacy,

100
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:58,427
and we figured that that was
the most important thing.

101
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,560
Lots of light, though.

102
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:01,865
Ta-da!

103
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,737
You can make it your own,
of course.

104
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:06,261
You can hang posters
and bring in potted plants.

105
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:08,132
You can blast your music
as loud as you want

106
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:10,831
because we cannot
hear you downstairs.

107
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:11,876
What do you think?

108
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:15,140
- It's perfect.
- Okay, good.

109
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:17,838
Win!

110
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,405
Well, I'm still interviewing,

111
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:21,669
but I'm hoping
to make a decision soon.

112
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,323
Here you go.

113
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,411
Oh, no, you don't
have to do that.

114
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:26,586
Oh, no, I insist.

115
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:27,804
You spent your energy
and your time

116
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:29,285
and your gas money
to be here. Please.

117
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,939
I appreciate it.

118
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,203
I have a really good feeling
about this, Millie. I do.

119
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:36,944
Me too.

120
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,424
Okay. I'll be in touch.

121
00:05:39,817 --> 00:05:41,296
She won't be in touch.

122
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:44,255
That's the last time I'll ever
set foot in that house.

123
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:45,866
One background check,

124
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,999
and she'll see that everything
on that resume is a total lie.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,784
I don't even wear glasses.

126
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,742
I'm just...
I'm trying to look legit.

127
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:53,788
So stupid.

128
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:10,108
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

129
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:14,547
Um, can I get
a job application?

130
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,157
Yeah, sure.

131
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:17,768
- There you go.
- Thanks.

132
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:30,519
I knew
she wouldn't call.

133
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,434
Why did I even think I had
a shot at that job?

134
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:35,133
Oh, well, at least I got
$20 out of it.

135
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,833
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

136
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,105
Roll it down.

137
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:54,064
Can't sleep here.

138
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:56,023
I'm so sorry. I...

139
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,503
I was driving
from my mom's house

140
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:58,939
and I got really sleepy,

141
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,636
and I just I pulled over
to take a nap. I'm sorry.

142
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:04,901
This is her actually.
Do you mind if I take it?

143
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:06,076
She's probably freaking out.

144
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:07,730
Don't text and drive.

145
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:08,993
I won't. I promise.

146
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,911
- Hello?
- Hi, may I speak to Millie?

147
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:17,479
Uh, this is her. She.

148
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,481
This is Nina Winchester.

149
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,483
I'm calling
to offer you the job.

150
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:24,007
I mean, if you're
still available.

151
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:25,966
Uh, you've probably got
a million job offers.

152
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,055
No. I mean, yes, yes.
I would love to.

153
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:30,318
Uh, when would
you like me to start?

154
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,974
Oh, my goodness.
As soon as possible?

155
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:35,279
Well, what about
this afternoon?

156
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,585
You know what?

157
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:38,369
- That would be great.
- Great.

158
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,807
Anyway, gotta run.
Bye, Millie.

159
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:41,678
Yes!

160
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:56,824
Hey!

161
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,652
Hey, I'm Millie.

162
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:02,350
Do you work
for the Winchesters?

163
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:04,744
I'm trying to get in,
but I don't know the code.

164
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:31,859
Nina?

165
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:35,253
Nina, it's Millie.

166
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:42,217
Nina?

167
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,402
Millie?
Millie, Millie, Millie!

168
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:55,708
Welcome. Hi.

169
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,927
Sorry. I, um, meant
to leave the gate open.

170
00:08:57,928 --> 00:09:00,539
Do you need me to help you bring
in your stuff from your car?

171
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,975
Oh, no, this is it.

172
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:04,194
- Great. Wow.
- Yeah.

173
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:06,066
Yeah, no, I put the rest of it
in a storage unit.

174
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,329
Okay, well, that's great. I'm
gonna put these up in your room.

175
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,201
Listen, I need
to write a PTA speech

176
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:13,334
that has to be a barn burner,

177
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:14,944
so I'm gonna be
stuck in my office.

178
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:16,599
But the cleaning supplies are
in this closet over there,

179
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:19,514
and... um, oh.

180
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:21,821
You're not wearing
your glasses.

181
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:24,564
Oh, I don't... I don't wear 'em
all the time. Contacts.

182
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,609
Oh.

183
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,090
Yeah, you look better
without them.

184
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:31,222
Yeah. Okay.

185
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,050
I'll be upstairs.

186
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:35,704
This is gonna be fun, Millie!

187
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:45,975
♪ People try to rape me
Always think I'm crazy ♪

188
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:49,501
♪ Make me burn
the candle right down ♪

189

♪ Baby ♪

190
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,508
No shoes on the furniture.

191
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,949
Um, hey. Hi.

192
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,605
You must be... Cece.

193
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,476
I'm Millie.

194
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:09,260
Hello.

195
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:12,393
Oh, hey. Hi! You met Millie.

196
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:13,524
Hi, baby.

197
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,352
Millie's gonna be
living with us,

198
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:16,484
and she's gonna be helping

199
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:17,616
with the cooking
and the cleaning.

200
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,921
And you know what?

201
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:20,619
She might even play
Candy Landwith you

202
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,664
if you ask her
with a pretty please.

203
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:24,318
She's gonna live with us?

204
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:26,886
Yes.
Andrew, I told you that.

205
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:30,846
I said she was gonna be living
in the guest room in the attic.

206
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:33,154
Doesn't this place look
incredible. Look at it.

207
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:38,506
- Thank you.
- Well, Millie, welcome.

208
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:40,029
Uh, thank you.

209
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,465
Are you hungry?
I'm sure we can

210
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:42,945
turn this dinner for three
into a dinner for four.

211
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:45,078
No, I'm probably
just gonna go upstairs

212
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,515
and, uh, get all settled in.

213
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:48,821
- You sure?
- If you don't mind,

214
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:51,258
I'll just come down afterwards
and tidy up.

215
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,477
Yeah, get settled.
Yeah, take your time.

216
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:54,827
We're so happy
that you're here.

217
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:56,307
You just let us know
if you change your mind.

218
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:58,309
Thanks.

219
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,665
You ordered from the wrong
Italian place again.

220
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:42,919
Knock, knock.

221
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,529
Hi.

222
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,793
That window doesn't open, sadly.

223
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,664
But there's a lot
of ventilation in this room,

224
00:11:49,665 --> 00:11:51,405
so you should never
get stuffy in here.

225
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:52,885
I got you some dinner.

226
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:55,496
Andrew always over-orders.

227
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:56,758
I put some water

228
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,933
in the mini fridge,
did you see that?

229
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,761
Yeah, I really don't
want to be a pain,

230
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:02,459
but if it is possible to try
and get the window open,

231
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,679
it'd be nice to get
some fresh air in here.

232
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,073
Yeah, I agree.
That's a great idea.

233
00:12:07,074 --> 00:12:09,075
I will talk to the handyman
about that.

234
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:11,686
Okay, cool. Is that the guy
that's down in the yard?

235
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,644
No, that's Enzo.
He's the groundskeeper.

236
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,124
Never mind him.

237
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,170
And then if I could just
get a key for the deadbolt.

238
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:20,129
Oh, my God, yes. The deadbolt.

239
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,219
That's so creepy.

240
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,701
This used to be Andrew's storage
closet for his files. Okay?

241
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:27,964
But, oh, my God,

242
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:30,488
closed window, deadbolt.

243
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:33,926
What kind of monsters are we?

244
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:35,754
- Uh...
- I will sort that out.

245
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,321
Oh, before I forget. Um...

246
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:40,976
This is for you. A present.

247
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:43,805
Also, just, I saw that your
phone was just really ancient,

248
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:46,155
and I wanted you to have that

249
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:48,984
because I uploaded
the credit card onto it

250
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:50,072
so you can use it
at the grocery store

251
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:51,465
and for gas.

252
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:54,033
Oh, um, I'll take good care
of it. Thank you.

253
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:58,908
Honestly, I'm like, so happy
that... you're here with us.

254
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,301
Thanks.

255
00:13:01,302 --> 00:13:02,694
Can I give you a hug?

256
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:06,523
Thank you, Millie.

257
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:08,830
Thank you. Okay.

258
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,311
Let me know
if you need anything else.

259
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:36,772
Shit.

260
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:50,524
No, no, no.

261
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:53,963
No, no, no.

262
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,456
Nina?

263
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:11,414
- Where are they?
- Where are what?

264
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:13,677
My PTA notes
for the meeting tonight!

265
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:14,983
They were right here
on the counter,

266
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,158
and now they're not here.

267
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,420
- Where are they?
- I didn't see any notes.

268
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:18,769
Bullshit!

269
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,815
Where are they?

270
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:22,861
- Nina, no, no.
- Hey.

271
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,297
Hey! What's going on?

272
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:27,867
Millie threw away my notes
for the meeting tonight.

273
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:31,131
Where are they?

274
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:35,134
Nina, why don't we go
check your office?

275
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:37,005
I have to get up
and do a speech

276
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:38,311
in front of everybody

277
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:39,747
and now I have nothing!

278
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,794
- Nina!
- What?

279
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:48,104
Do you have a copy...

280
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:50,192
...on your computer?

281
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:52,021
I wrote them by hand!

282
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:54,588
Oh, fuck!

283
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,720
I always think better
when I write by hand.

284
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:58,114
Where's my nail at?

285
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:07,079
All right.
Come here, come here.

286
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,951
It's okay.

287
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,436
Let's take
a deep breath, okay?

288
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:21,093
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

289
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:24,924
I'm gonna pick you up.

290
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:38,893
Here's the plan. I am going
to take Cece to school,

291
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:40,851
and you...

292
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:43,115
you are going to take
a hot shower.

293
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,812
You're gonna have
a nice long breakfast,

294
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:46,727
and then you have all day
to work on your speech,

295
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:50,122
and you can still make it
to the salon for a touch up.

296
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:51,775
You'll have just enough time
to get your roots done.

297
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:53,081
I love you so much.

298
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:54,257
- I love you.
- I love you.

299
00:15:57,652 --> 00:15:59,697
You need to be
more careful next time.

300
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,397
You've ruined my entire day.

301
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:06,269
I'm sorry.

302
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:16,366
I am so sorry.

303
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,238
Don-- Don't worry about it.

304
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,587
I don't know what's been
going on with her lately.

305
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,415
She's...

306
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,983
she's been on a real
emotional roller coaster.

307
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,637
Oh, it's probably the hor--

308
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,466
um, Mercury in retrograde.

309
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:32,294
Didn't peg you
for the star-chart type.

310
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:33,514
Guilty.

311
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,605
Let me help you clean up.

312
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:40,041
- It's a fuckin' mess in here.
- No, no, no. I got it.

313
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,217
I got it. You go get ready.

314
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:43,567
I don't want you
to be late for Cece.

315
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:45,830
Thank you.

316
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,271
Tomorrow will be better.

317
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,231
It'll be better, I promise.

318
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,016
Okay.

319
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,152
Yeah.

320
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:06,329
Cece! Let's hit the road!

321
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,134
What are you doing here?

322
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,092
I work here.

323
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:32,877
What are you doing here?

324
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:35,141
You...

325
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:27,409
I don't really
fit in very well

326
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,151
with those other PTA moms.

327
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:33,676
I guess I didn't realize
how stressed I've been.

328
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:36,854
It's probably just all the new
hormones making you go crazy.

329
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,336
I wouldn't say anything
to Andrew.

330
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:42,469
Get out.

331
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,383
I have to shower.

332
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:46,211
And you're gonna
handle dinner later.

333
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:47,213
Yeah.

334
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:49,431
It smells amazing.

335
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:51,216
It's chicken piccata.

336
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:52,565
Mmm.

337
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:54,871
Oh, I picked this up for Cece.

338
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:57,831
Oh, these are fantastic.
She's gonna love these.

339
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:59,137
Someone did not
get her snack today,

340
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,356
and she's a very hungry
little ballerina.

341
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:05,317
Why don't you get her started,
and I'll be right back down?

342
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,536
Okay.

343
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:13,761
Hey, Cece,

344
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,371
how was class?

345
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:21,898
Would you, uh, like juice
or... or water?

346
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:24,250
Juice.
But this glass is dirty.

347
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:27,208
Really? I just took it out
of the dishwasher.

348
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,601
Juice is a privilege.

349
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,865
Not something you drink
out of a dirty glass.

350
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:33,476
Of course not.

351
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:49,056
This looks amazing.

352
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:51,625
Doesn't it, Cece? Way better
than dinosaur nuggets.

353
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,280
Hey, Millie,

354
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:57,805
why don't you grab
a place setting and join us?

355
00:19:58,806 --> 00:19:59,893
Uh...

356
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,503
No, I... I already ate.

357
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:02,549
Oh, we insist.

358
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:04,942
Don't we, Cece?

359
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,294
Um...

360
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:11,166
I hope you guys like it.

361
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,016
Come in.

362
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:39,541
Hey.

363
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,457
- Hey.
- Sorry to bother you.

364
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:44,590
Got something for you.

365
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:45,766
Cece insisted.

366
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:48,638
- She's so sweet.
- Yeah.

367
00:20:57,995 --> 00:21:00,214
♪ You can tell me ♪

368
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:02,303
♪ You don't love her ♪

369
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:05,393
♪ But you should
probably tell her too ♪

370
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:06,568
♪ 'Cause I can't keep...♪

371
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,615
No, no, no.

372
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,748
Absolutely fucking not!

373
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:13,837
Oh, my God.

374
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,718
I want you to feel safe here.

375
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:27,851
I do.

376
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:32,421
For your door, as requested.

377
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,510
Thanks.

378
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,429
So how was last night?
With Andrew?

379
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,649
Good.

380
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,173
I made chicken piccata.

381
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:48,176
He's a dream, isn't he?

382
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,613
He pretends to like everything
I make him,

383
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:52,615
even if he hates it.

384
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,361
Mmm.

385
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:04,278
That's a lot of bacon, Millie.

386
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,889
Are you trying to kill us?

387
00:22:11,678 --> 00:22:12,853
Where are you going?

388
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:16,508
I have...

389
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:17,944
Saturday off.

390
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:19,119
Isn't that
what we talked about?

391
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,818
No, I...
I can't spare you today.

392
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,038
I missed
my hair salon appointment

393
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,346
because you threw away
my notes.

394
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,173
Remember?

395
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:33,002
I have a meeting
that I can't miss.

396
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:35,571
You have a meeting?

397
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:37,573
What's the meeting for?

398
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:42,229
If I could just have
a couple hours off,

399
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,317
and then I'll come back.

400
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:45,754
Millie, absolutely not.

401
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:47,539
- Baby?
- I can't have you... What?

402
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,542
Sweetheart, it's okay.
She can go.

403
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,675
- But, Andy, it's your day off.
- I know, exactly.

404
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:56,983
And that's why we're gonna go
to the park... fly this kite.

405
00:22:56,984 --> 00:22:58,201
And we've been waiting
all week to fly, right?

406
00:22:58,202 --> 00:22:59,159
We're doing donuts,
we're doing kites,

407
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,466
and then we're doing ballet.

408
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:03,251
Go. Take your time.

409
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:09,388
- Bye, Mama.
- Bye, baby.

410
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:15,959
Have fun.

411
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:21,661
Thanks.

412
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:28,797
Hey, how are you doin'?

413
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,495
I'm good.

414
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:32,061
Still writing in your journal?

415
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:34,716
Uh, yeah.
Do you wanna read it?

416
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:35,935
God, no.

417
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,633
I have enough shit
to read as it is.

418
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:41,027
So you left the job
at Charlie's?

419
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:44,813
Well, this housekeeping job
just sort of fell into my lap.

420
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:47,250
And it's live-in,
so I'm saving a fortune on rent.

421
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:49,339
Okay, that's good.

422
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,212
I have my new address here,

423
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:53,953
and phone number.

424
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:56,259
The family is really amazing.

425
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,913
I feel... I feel lucky.

426
00:23:57,914 --> 00:24:00,220
Must make meeting new people
a little tough, though,

427
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:01,700
having to live with a family.

428
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:03,223
I mean, you would
think that, right?

429
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:07,227
But I have already met
a ton of really cool nannies.

430
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:08,664
Any mannies in there?

431
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,711
Are you asking me
about my love life, Pam?

432
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:14,190
If I know how Tinder works,

433
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:17,019
or if I'm horn dogging
all over Great Neck

434
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,499
because I haven't gotten laid
in ten years?

435
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,024
No. I'm just saying
human connections are important.

436
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:23,896
Definitely.

437
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:25,725
But hold onto this job,
Millie.

438
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:27,857
And the living situation.

439
00:24:30,077 --> 00:24:32,382
You'll need both,
or you'll be back at Bedford

440
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:35,647
serving the five years
left on your sentence.

441
00:24:35,648 --> 00:24:37,953
And I don't like that for you.

442
00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:39,869
I don't like that
for me, either.

443
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:50,749
- Hi, Nina, I'm just--
- I need you to pick up Cece

444
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,665
from ballet class, 1:45,
and don't be late.

445
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:57,670
Um, okay, where is it? Nina?

446
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,629
What?

447
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,414
Ballet school?

448
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,981
Ballet class.

449
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:08,593
Little kids.

450
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:10,290
Fuck.

451
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:11,813
Tendu right.

452
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:15,164
And curtsy
and open to the left.

453
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:16,601
Foot behind you.

454
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:19,299
Excellent, and close to first.

455
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,170
Fabulous class today.
Thank you.

456
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:23,390
Let's go get
our bags and shoes.

457
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,611
Great job.

458
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:30,049
- Hi. Who are you looking for?
- Uh, Cece.

459
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,877
Cecilia Winchester.

460
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:33,053
Are you Nina's new girl?

461
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:36,491
- Yes. Hi, I'm Millie.
- Hi.

462
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:39,319
Hi!

463
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,017
Cece! Hey,
I'm here to pick you up.

464
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:44,193
I'm spending the night
at Emma's.

465
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:46,892
We arranged it weeks ago.
She has all her things.

466
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:48,328
Oh, no, no, no.

467
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:49,851
Nina just called me
and asked me to pick her up,

468
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:51,113
so she probably
changed her mind.

469
00:25:51,114 --> 00:25:52,898
Oh.

470
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:54,465
Okay, let me check.

471
00:25:58,861 --> 00:25:59,906
Nina!

472
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:02,864
Hi, it's Patrice.

473
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:04,736
Your girl is here.
She's insisting

474
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:07,087
she needs to pick up Cece.

475
00:26:12,353 --> 00:26:13,484
I know.

476
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,355
I know.

477
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:17,357
No, it's no problem at all.

478
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:19,578
It's impossible to find
reliable help.

479
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:22,710
Oh, would you like to confirm?

480
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,149
Have fun.

481
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:29,848
We figured it out.

482
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:32,329
Okay, take care. Bye.

483
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,331
Wow,
they really are beautiful.

484
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:37,246
So happy
we'll be able to use them,

485
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:38,683
Mother Winchester.

486
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:41,121
Well, the pattern is vintage,
of course.

487
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:42,992
Millie.

488
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,953
I told you Cece was having
a sleepover tonight.

489
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:50,303
There was no need
to make a scene.

490
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:55,874
This is how you allow the help
to dress in your home?

491
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,919
Uh, this is Andrew's mother,
Mrs. Winchester.

492
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,225
She's downsizing,

493
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:01,444
so she has brought us
her mother's china.

494
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:02,795
- Yes.
- Isn't it lovely?

495
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:05,667
Isn't it?

496
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,626
- Yes.
- I know.

497
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,107
Andrew loves these dishes.

498
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,979
I want you...

499
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,676
to put them somewhere safe

500
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:18,331
'cause Nina's likely
to trip over herself

501
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:20,028
and smash them all to pieces.

502
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:23,249
Guilty as charged.

503
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,859
- Andrew!
- Oh.

504
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,601
- Mother.
- Oh, Andrew, where's your tie?

505
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:30,299
I know,
I'm too casual. I'm sorry.

506
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,214
- Your hair is fabulous.
- Thank you, darling.

507
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:34,434
Not a root in sight. Is...

508
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:36,044
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yes, it is.

509
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:38,046
Can't wait to eat off
of those plates.

510
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:39,657
Family heirlooms.

511
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,572
- So happy it's back.
- Me too.

512
00:27:48,188 --> 00:27:50,190
This fucking window.

513
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:21,568
Dishes are still in the sink.

514
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,613
Yeah, I know.
I'm kinda lettin' em soak.

515
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:24,876
Uh,
they've been soaking

516
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:26,791
for three days.

517
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:28,053
Well, now,
you know, it's kinda...

518
00:28:28,054 --> 00:28:30,098
Glug, glug, glug,
glug, glug. Ding.

519
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:31,752
Glug, glug, glug.

520
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,102
...home
with everybody going out.

521
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,321
I'm going to ask you one...

522
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:40,413
I'm not gonna ask you
what you sell.

523
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:42,415
I'm gonna go on here
to Patsy, all right?

524
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,765
Ah, Family Feud.

525
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:46,245
I'm so sorry.

526
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:47,986
Um... I...
I couldn't get some...

527
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:49,335
- I'll leave you alone.
- No, no. Please.

528
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:50,292
- Get out of your way.
- Sit, please. No, sit.

529
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:51,642
Come on.

530
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:54,775
Please stay.

531
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,778
Oh, I love this show.

532
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:59,345
Me too.

533
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:01,869
I've only ever seen
the Steve Harvey one.

534
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,002
- Really? Oh, this is classic.
- Yeah.

535
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:05,351
This is Richard Dawson.

536
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:06,745
Fashion icon.

537
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:09,964
- He's an OG.
- Yeah?

538
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:12,097
He has
some spectacular sideburns.

539
00:29:12,098 --> 00:29:14,012
He sure does.

540
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:16,928
Man, my family would have
killed on this show.

541
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:18,668
They are absolute vultures.

542
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:19,757
Especially my mother.

543
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,194
What about you?
You... your, um...

544
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:23,500
parents, are they game people?

545
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:27,547
Oh, we don't really
keep in touch anymore.

546
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:28,635
Oh.

547
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:29,680
I'm sorry.

548
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:32,378
That's gotta be hard.

549
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:34,902
Uh, not really, no.

550
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:36,775
I mean, even if we were,
they probably wouldn't...

551
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:39,211
be into this.

552
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:41,517
They're kinda like
the opposite of fun.

553
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:42,650
Well, I'll tell you what.

554
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:45,348
You can be on our team.

555
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,003
It'd be me and you...

556
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:51,005
and Nina and my mom.

557
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:52,747
Nina's parents don't
make the cut?

558
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:55,184
They died when she was a kid.

559
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:57,883
- That's awful.
- Yeah.

560
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:00,536
It's a crazy story, actually.

561
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:01,930
They died in a house fire.

562
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:06,064
No one knows
how it was started.

563
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:07,935
Nina made it out,
her parents didn't.

564
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:10,243
For a long time, the police
actually thought that she...

565
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:16,901
Can you imagine...

566
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:19,425
living with that
your entire life?

567
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:21,558
- That'd be terrible.
- What would be terrible?

568
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:24,257
There she is.

569
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,040
Hey.

570
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,956
Name a cartoon bird.

571
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:31,480
What are you doing up?

572
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,439
What do you mean?
I can say the same about you.

573
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,223
I'm watching Family Feud.

574
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:36,485
Mmm.

575
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:38,226
- At 2:00 a.m.?
- You wanna get in on this?

576
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:40,663
Some Dawson? Wanna get
some Dawson on you?

577
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:42,318
No, I'm good. It's...

578
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:44,277
Baby, it's 2:00 a.m.

579
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:45,887
Okay.

580
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,193
I'mma go to bed.

581
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:49,586
Let me know how it ends.

582
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:52,459
All right.

583
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,941
Goodnight.

584
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,682
- I'll be right up.
- Okay.

585
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:02,381
Uh, cartoon bird,
little Katie.

586
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:03,512
Three answers remaining.

587
00:31:03,513 --> 00:31:05,036
- Daffy Duck.
- Um.

588
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:06,385
Let's see
if you made it.

589
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:09,562
It's late. I should
probably get some sleep.

590
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,175
This isn't working.

591
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:16,265
- What?
- This isn't working.

592
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:20,138
So I'm gonna need you
to pack your stuff

593
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:21,487
and leave
first thing in the morning

594
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:22,837
before Cece wakes up.

595
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,707
So she doesn't get upset.

596
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:26,449
No, Nina.

597
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:29,147
I... I...

598
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:30,844
I didn't think anyone was
gonna be down here.

599
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:32,411
You told me I could use
the screening room.

600
00:31:32,412 --> 00:31:34,108
I'm gonna need
the phone back as well.

601
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:35,893
Please, Nina.

602
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,895
I will do anything

603
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,548
to make it up to you.
I promise.

604
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:40,637
Can you just give me...

605
00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:42,509
one more chance?

606
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:47,166
Um...

607
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:48,907
Fine.

608
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:51,387
One week.

609
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:53,562
Okay?

610
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:56,304
But you're gonna
have to dress appropriately

611
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:57,654
around the house from now on.

612
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:00,179
Yeah, of course. Sorry.

613
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:07,708
Oh, Millie.

614
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:12,278
Stay the fuck away
from my husband.

615
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:31,383
- Mmm.
- And so my nanny's going on

616
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:33,646
and on about her dead dog,

617
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:36,518
and I don't mean
to be a B-I-T-C-H,

618
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:39,304
but since when did I become
a canine grief counselor?

619
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:41,784
Meanwhile,
Emma is late for school.

620
00:32:41,785 --> 00:32:44,091
- Mmm.
- I'm missing yoga.

621
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,484
You know what yoga means
to me.

622
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:47,529
- It's everything.
- That's so unfortunate.

623
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,704
Thank you.

624
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:53,361
Well, we are going to be
looking for a nanny soon.

625
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:55,450
Oh, my God, Nina!
You're pregnant.

626
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:57,626
- Nina.
- I knew it.

627
00:32:57,627 --> 00:32:59,759
No. Not... Not yet.

628
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,848
We are making a plan.

629
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:03,458
We've been going to see
this incredible

630
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:04,982
fertility specialist
in the city.

631
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,461
- Cool.
- Andrew insists

632
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:07,941
on sparing no expense,

633
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:09,725
of course. So, yeah.

634
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:12,163
- That's wonderful.
- Ooh, yeah.

635
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:15,079
We will find you the most
fantastic nanny, I promise.

636
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,558
- Absolutely.
- Thanks.

637
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,952
Oh, this is
Cece's pediatrician.

638
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:20,868
- I will be right back.
- Oh.

639
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:23,001
Fill our tea.

640
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:27,787
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

641
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:29,267
I really thought
she was pregnant.

642
00:33:29,268 --> 00:33:30,398
I know,
we were all thinking it.

643
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,617
I mean,
have you seen her skin?

644
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:33,053
God, and how about
those roots?

645
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:34,272
My God.
You'd think she would take

646
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:36,013
better care of herself
for Andrew.

647
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,797
- He's so fucking hot.
- He is.

648
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:40,278
And especially because
they have an airtight prenup.

649
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,931
- Mmm.
- Okay. You know,

650
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:44,238
she did not have a dime
when they got married.

651
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,674
She'll be sleeping
on the street

652
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:47,154
if she doesn't get
her shit together.

653
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,896
Cece? Would he get custody,
considering...

654
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:53,030
Of course.
After what she did.

655
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,423
How many months she spent
in that awful psych ward?

656
00:33:55,424 --> 00:33:57,164
- Nine.
- Nine.

657
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:58,470
Nine months.

658
00:33:58,471 --> 00:33:59,906
I mean, good Lord,

659
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:01,168
I do not know
how he puts up with her.

660
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:03,431
Because he is a saint.

661
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:04,998
He's a hot saint.

662
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:08,393
Hot Saint Andrew. Oh, my God.

663
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:10,177
- Ooh.
- What did I miss?

664
00:34:10,178 --> 00:34:12,962
Oh, we're just talking
spring fundraiser.

665
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:14,051
- Ooh.
- Please,

666
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,575
save us with a theme idea.

667
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:20,057
Stop lurking.

668
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,189
Those women were right
about one thing.

669
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,018
Andrew is definitely a saint
for standing by Nina.

670
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:27,281
I can't believe she lied
about being pregnant.

671
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:29,544
Everything she's told me
is a lie.

672
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:31,155
It wasn't the hormones
making her crazy.

673
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:33,331
She actually is crazy.

674
00:34:33,332 --> 00:34:34,636
Poor Andrew.

675
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:35,855
As soon as I save up
enough money,

676
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:37,423
I am out of here.

677
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:42,080
Today wasn't a total disaster.

678
00:34:43,037 --> 00:34:45,082
Uh, thank you.

679
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,127
I'm gonna need you
to watch Cece next Saturday.

680
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:49,564
Andrew and I have
an appointment in the city,

681
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:51,088
and I know it's your day off,

682
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,394
but I trust
that it won't be a problem.

683
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:54,483
Uh...

684
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:57,660
- We'll have fun.
- Good.

685
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,734
Haloperidol.

686
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:35,045
Acute fucking psychosis?

687
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:40,920
Hey, Lexi,
it's Millie. Listen.

688
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:42,139
I really need to make
some extra money

689
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,488
so I can quit this job.

690
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,794
Do you think
you could, um, ask your cousin

691
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:48,275
if I could get a job
at the warehouse?

692
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:49,494
I'll do anything. I'll clean,

693
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:51,148
I'll set boxes,
I'll scrub toilets.

694
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,237
I just really need
to get out of here.

695
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:55,021
You're leaving?

696
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:56,066
What?

697
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:58,198
No, no, no.

698
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,678
I'm gonna...

699
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:00,897
make you lunch.

700
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,551
What are you in the mood for?

701
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:04,945
A bologna sandwich?

702
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:06,946
Okay.

703
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:09,296
But you said you needed
to get out of this place

704
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:10,428
on the phone just now.

705
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:11,777
No.

706
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:13,040
You misheard me.

707
00:36:15,477 --> 00:36:17,479
One bologna sandwich
coming right up.

708
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:22,440
So how was, uh...

709
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:24,050
how was school this week?

710
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:27,488
Learn anything fun
or interesting?

711
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:30,318
It's school.
It's not fun or interesting.

712
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:33,364
What about boys?

713
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:35,235
Got any crushes?

714
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:37,411
Ew, no. Why would you even
ask me that?

715
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:39,152
I am just...

716
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:40,589
trying to make
some small talk.

717
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:43,243
Forget it.

718
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:44,332
I'm not hungry anyway.

719
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:48,597
Okay.

720
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:54,776
You don't have to be
my friend, you know.

721
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:56,430
It's not part of your job.

722
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:58,258
Well, I'd like to be.

723
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,781
Why?

724
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:01,479
'Cause I like you.

725
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,611
No, you don't.

726
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:07,746
"Do you want juice
or water?"

727
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:09,226
"Juice, please."

728
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,531
"Don't spill.

729
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:12,141
"Juice is a privilege."

730
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:14,274
"I won't."
"Did you go to the salon today?"

731
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:15,710
"Yes."

732
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:16,972
"You look very nice."

733
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:19,453
- "Thank you."
- Cece, would you like some

734
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:20,934
dinosaur chicken nuggets
and ketchup?

735
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:23,109
Ketchup makes a mess.

736
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,632
Yes, it does.

737
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:33,294
Cece, where did you find
this troll?

738
00:37:35,165 --> 00:37:37,166
Were you in my room?

739
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:39,691
Cece, this troll is
very special to me.

740
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:41,736
I don't want you going into
my room, do you understand?

741
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:43,564
You need to stay
out of the attic.

742
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:45,740
So do you.

743
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:47,439
Hey.

744
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:55,707
Hey, Cece,

745
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:56,795
can you go play
in your bedroom

746
00:37:56,796 --> 00:37:57,840
for a little bit, please?

747
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,585
What happened?

748
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:06,326
Premature
ovarian insufficiency.

749
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:07,459
We've been trying for years.

750
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:09,982
At least now we know.

751
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:11,766
- I'm sorry.
- I've just...

752
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:14,508
Man, I've just always wanted
a lot of kids.

753
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:16,859
Like a... Like a whole
soccer team full.

754
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:20,340
Nina and I
were only children like you.

755
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,908
Well, at least you have Cece.

756
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:24,171
Of course, of course.

757
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:29,089
I know it sounds selfish.

758
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,570
I love Cece.

759
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:34,789
I've always wanted a child
of my own with Nina.

760
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,356
I didn't realize...

761
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:40,187
Oh, Cece is...
she's absolutely my daughter.

762
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:43,668
She's just not
my biological daughter.

763
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:45,670
You're an amazing dad.

764
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:48,107
Look, I just really don't know
how she's gonna take this.

765
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:51,851
She's been so fragile lately.

766
00:38:54,288 --> 00:38:57,943
I really don't think that she
can handle the disappointment.

767
00:38:57,944 --> 00:38:59,074
She has you.

768
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:01,251
I don't think
that I am enough.

769
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:19,921
It's not fair!
I did everything I could!

770
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:21,575
Nina,
it's not your fault.

771
00:39:21,576 --> 00:39:23,751
You wish I was gone.

772
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:25,100
God! Wait! Nina, no!

773
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:26,319
- Hello?
- No, no, no!

774
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,756
Andrew, are you...
are you okay?

775
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,759
What?

776
00:39:33,806 --> 00:39:35,067
Oh, my God.

777
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:38,287
Andrew, are you okay?

778
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:40,942
What? You overheard
those PTA cunts

779
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:42,422
saying that I'm crazy?

780
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:44,816
That I don't deserve
my husband?

781
00:39:44,817 --> 00:39:46,862
That I belong in a nuthouse?

782
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,603
Andrew!

783
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,219
Let go of this.

784
00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:00,614
- Wrap this around your hand.
- Thank you.

785
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:01,790
Alive and well.

786
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:32,430
I cleaned up
the mess from last night.

787
00:40:34,562 --> 00:40:36,869
Sorry I wasn't honest
about the baby.

788
00:40:38,697 --> 00:40:40,262
I guess I was...

789
00:40:40,263 --> 00:40:41,830
trying to manifest.

790
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:44,398
Or something.

791
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:48,967
It's okay, I get it.

792
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:52,450
I don't know...
...how I'm gonna
face Andrew's mother.

793
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:57,803
Anyway,

794
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:01,196
I realized I need to stop
holding onto things

795
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:03,329
and just start fresh.

796
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,766
So these are
practically brand-new,

797
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:07,595
and I want you to have them.

798
00:41:09,118 --> 00:41:10,163
I...

799
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:12,120
I... I can't.

800
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:13,600
No, seriously,

801
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:15,733
these are gonna be thrown
in the bin at Goodwill.

802
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:17,475
This would look
amazing on you.

803
00:41:18,258 --> 00:41:19,825
Millie, take it.

804
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:22,087
Thanks.

805
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:24,350
Well, Andrew took Cece
to pancakes,

806
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:27,396
so you don't really have to
worry about breakfast
this morning.

807
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:29,834
But I do need a favor.

808
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:32,751
I need you to look into tickets
for a musical called Showdown.

809
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:36,405
Andrew's been dying to see it,

810
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:38,843
and I want to do something to

811
00:41:38,844 --> 00:41:40,498
make it up to him.

812
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:42,716
Sure.

813
00:41:42,717 --> 00:41:43,892
This Saturday,

814
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:46,503
if you can manage,

815
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,549
and an overnight
at a high-end hotel.

816
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,724
Splurge on a suite.

817
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:52,987
Something romantic.

818
00:41:52,988 --> 00:41:55,686
And Cece will be
at a friend's house.

819
00:41:55,687 --> 00:41:57,166
I'll arrange for her to...

820
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,907
uh, be out of the house

821
00:41:59,908 --> 00:42:02,520
and you can just have
the weekend to yourself.

822
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:05,217
That sounds great.

823
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:07,262
I'll see what I can do.

824
00:42:07,263 --> 00:42:08,961
You're a lifesaver, Millie.

825
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:12,921
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

826
00:42:24,846 --> 00:42:27,326
You're with
the Winchesters, right?

827
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:29,590
- Yeah.
- I'm with the Leightons.

828
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:32,157
Suzanne?

829
00:42:32,158 --> 00:42:33,246
Right.

830
00:42:34,508 --> 00:42:37,163
Cece's not that good, is she?

831
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:42,689
Don't worry.
No one gives her any shit.

832
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,562
Not after everything
she's been through.

833
00:42:46,085 --> 00:42:47,347
What do you mean?

834
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:48,956
Seriously?

835
00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:51,132
All the psycho mom shit?

836
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:53,527
I know she spent some time
in a psych ward, but...

837
00:42:56,225 --> 00:42:57,270
Um...

838
00:43:00,142 --> 00:43:04,103
Nina Winchester tried
to drown her kid in a bathtub.

839
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,365
- What?
- Yeah.

840
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:08,759
It's like all the PTA bitches
talk about.

841
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,891
When Cece was a baby,

842
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:13,851
Nina threw her
in a tub of running water,

843
00:43:13,852 --> 00:43:15,243
then tried to off herself

844
00:43:15,244 --> 00:43:17,594
by swallowing
a shit ton of pills.

845
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,726
Luckily, her husband got
freaked out

846
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:21,423
when he couldn't get
ahold of her,

847
00:43:21,424 --> 00:43:24,383
then called the police
for a wellness check.

848
00:43:24,384 --> 00:43:28,256
It's, like, fucked up, right?

849
00:43:28,257 --> 00:43:31,172
Great job,
dancers. Thank you.

850
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:33,436
- Let's get our belongings.
- All right.

851
00:43:45,187 --> 00:43:47,581
- Your car smells like feet.
- Thank you.

852
00:43:52,325 --> 00:43:53,369
Hey.

853
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:57,459
What do you know
about this family?

854
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,678
Sorry, no English.

855
00:43:58,679 --> 00:43:59,854
Oh, bullshit.

856
00:44:02,161 --> 00:44:03,640
I know you shouldn't be here.

857
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,165
Why?

858
00:44:07,427 --> 00:44:08,601
Leave him alone.

859
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:13,868
You've no business
talking to Enzo.

860
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:17,697
What is this?

861
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:20,395
They're the Broadway tickets
and the hotel reservation.

862
00:44:20,396 --> 00:44:22,441
- For Saturday?
- Yeah.

863
00:44:22,442 --> 00:44:25,705
But why would I have you
book tickets...

864
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:28,534
for the day that I'm driving
Cece to arts camp in D.C.?

865
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:30,971
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know, but you did.

866
00:44:30,972 --> 00:44:33,060
No, I didn't.

867
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:36,629
And I assume that these
are non-refundable now,
at this point?

868
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,936
Nina, I did
what you asked me to do.

869
00:44:38,937 --> 00:44:40,938
Fine. They're gonna
come out of your paycheck.

870
00:44:40,939 --> 00:44:42,853
And I'm so sorry about that,
but it was your mistake,

871
00:44:42,854 --> 00:44:44,768
and you're gonna have to cover
the fee.

872
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:46,334
Nina, I can't afford that.

873
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:47,684
I don't care!

874
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,163
It was your mistake.
You're gonna cover it.

875
00:44:49,164 --> 00:44:50,948
Nina, that's more
than I have saved.

876
00:44:50,949 --> 00:44:52,819
Hey.

877
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,082
- Hello.
- Hi.

878
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:59,347
Just about
cleaned out the florist,

879
00:44:59,348 --> 00:45:01,699
so otherwise I would have...
I would have got you more.

880
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:03,701
What's wrong?

881
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:06,093
Millie booked tickets

882
00:45:06,094 --> 00:45:08,313
for a non-refundable weekend
for us

883
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:11,098
that we can't even use.

884
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:13,361
And she's gonna have
to pay for it. Sorry.

885
00:45:13,362 --> 00:45:15,059
No, she doesn't.
That's okay.

886
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,669
We'll just call the credit card
company and have it reversed.

887
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,018
I don't think that's a thing.

888
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:20,325
That is a thing.
That's a thing.

889
00:45:20,326 --> 00:45:22,241
You don't have to pay
for anything.

890
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,764
Thank you.

891
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,810
I'm sorry.

892
00:45:34,514 --> 00:45:35,689
Sweetheart?

893
00:45:45,438 --> 00:45:46,743
All this stuff
for a week?

894
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,920
I don't want her
to get homesick.

895
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:18,297
Okay. Sorry. Shit. Okay.

896
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:19,820
Sorry.

897
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:31,004
I am so sorry. I usually get
dressed before I come out.

898
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:33,790
No, it's really my fault.
I was actually just...

899
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,967
I was coming
to confess something to you.

900
00:46:38,186 --> 00:46:41,363
I wanted to let you know
that I couldn't get
the tickets refunded.

901
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:43,888
- Shit.
- Yeah.

902
00:46:47,282 --> 00:46:49,893
So I think
you should take them

903
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:51,895
and go to the show
with a friend

904
00:46:51,896 --> 00:46:54,158
and stay in the room,
charge whatever you want.

905
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:56,639
Room service.
I want you to enjoy yourself.

906
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,250
That is...

907
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:02,122
really nice of you, but...

908
00:47:02,123 --> 00:47:04,516
I can't. I don't have anyone
I can bring.

909
00:47:04,517 --> 00:47:06,388
You gotta have somebody.

910
00:47:08,521 --> 00:47:10,088
I wish I did, but I don't.

911
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:19,184
Okay, well, just, um...
how about you and I go?

912
00:47:20,576 --> 00:47:22,970
We can come back tonight.
I can...

913
00:47:24,189 --> 00:47:25,624
I can sweeten the deal
a little bit,

914
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:28,367
throw in a slice of pizza,
maybe a hot apple cider?

915
00:47:29,237 --> 00:47:31,499
I'll just tell Nina that I...

916
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,675
exchanged the tickets
and I can take her next week.

917
00:47:33,676 --> 00:47:35,939
No, I can't have you do that.

918
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,984
Oh, come on, we could both
use a night out.

919
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:40,857
I know we could.
Why not?

920
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,947
I mean, it's supposed to be
a great show.

921
00:47:44,774 --> 00:47:45,863
Okay.

922
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:49,127

00:49:16,866 --> 00:49:18,476
Wasn't pizza
a part of this deal?

948

Yeah. You know what?
I think I got a better idea.

950
00:49:23,612 --> 00:49:25,135
Holy shit,
that was amazing.

951
00:49:26,354 --> 00:49:27,702

- Yeah.

952
00:49:27,703 --> 00:49:28,791
Yeah.

953
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:32,490
This place is
really fancy.

954
00:49:32,491 --> 00:49:34,144
Well, it's charming,

955
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:35,710
in an old New York
kind of way.

956
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:37,234
Yeah.

957
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:38,757
I... I don't...

958
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:40,367
I don't really
know what I should order.

959
00:49:40,368 --> 00:49:42,239
Well, how about we just get
one of everything?

960
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,588
- Everything?
- Everything.

961
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:46,113
- We can't do that.
- Yeah, we can.

962
00:49:49,377 --> 00:49:50,552
You like martinis?

963
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:52,553
I guess. I don't know.

964
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:54,425
- Well, I guess we'll find out.
- Yeah.

965
00:49:54,426 --> 00:49:55,643
To new adventures.

966
00:49:55,644 --> 00:49:56,776
Cheers.

967
00:50:01,955 --> 00:50:03,129
I mean,
you're funny, you're...

968
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,783
you're caring,
you're great with kids.

969
00:50:04,784 --> 00:50:06,872
I just don't understand why
you're cleaning people's houses.

970
00:50:06,873 --> 00:50:09,309
You should be out there
living your best life.

971
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,094
And have you ever thought
about what

972
00:50:11,095 --> 00:50:13,793
you want to do with your time
on this Earth?

973
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:17,971
- I don't know. No, not really.
- Why not?

974
00:50:20,234 --> 00:50:21,408
What about you?

975
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:22,844
Are you...

976
00:50:22,845 --> 00:50:25,543
living your best life doing...

977
00:50:25,544 --> 00:50:27,414
I don't even know what you do.

978
00:50:27,415 --> 00:50:29,025
I run a data processing company

979
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,114
that my father left me.

980
00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:33,159
Basically, I get paid
a lot of money

981
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,683
to do really boring shit.

982
00:50:35,684 --> 00:50:38,382
- Gotcha.
- I mean, all I've ever
really wanted to do

983
00:50:38,383 --> 00:50:40,863
was to be a husband
and a father, honestly.

984
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,343
That's really sweet.

985
00:50:43,344 --> 00:50:45,433
What about you?
Do you want kids?

986
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:47,609
Yeah.

987
00:50:48,262 --> 00:50:49,263
Someday.

988
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:52,179
With the right person,
of course.

989
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:54,528
I mean, I... I...

990
00:50:54,529 --> 00:50:56,574
feel like I won the lottery
with Nina, and I should feel

991
00:50:56,575 --> 00:50:58,924
- like I'm living my best life.
- But you're not?

992
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:00,534
I love my wife.

993
00:51:00,535 --> 00:51:02,493
I really do.

994
00:51:02,494 --> 00:51:04,582
I just feel like
she's angry all the time,

995
00:51:04,583 --> 00:51:06,192
and I don't know why.

996
00:51:06,193 --> 00:51:08,630
I feel like every conversation
we have ends in a tirade.

997
00:51:09,936 --> 00:51:12,807
If it makes you feel
any better, same.

998
00:51:12,808 --> 00:51:15,810
I mean, she used to be
so different. She was, uh...

999
00:51:15,811 --> 00:51:17,856
She was... loving,

1000
00:51:17,857 --> 00:51:19,902
and she was kind,
and she was generous.

1001
00:51:20,686 --> 00:51:22,382
She was affectionate.

1002
00:51:22,383 --> 00:51:24,993
I mean, all I want to do is
make her happy

1003
00:51:24,994 --> 00:51:26,908
and I genuinely
don't know how.

1004
00:51:26,909 --> 00:51:28,476
Andrew, it's not you.

1005
00:51:30,043 --> 00:51:32,000
I should not have said that.
I'm sorry.

1006
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:33,524
No, it's okay. I mean, I see
the way that she treats you,

1007
00:51:33,525 --> 00:51:35,092
and I hate it.

1008
00:51:36,963 --> 00:51:38,051
I hate it.

1009
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:41,881
I feel like
I'm letting you down.

1010
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:43,578
You're not.

1011
00:51:49,323 --> 00:51:51,325
Pretty sure there's
a dance floor in there.

1012
00:51:55,242 --> 00:51:57,417
- You want to go dancing?
- Should we hit it?

1013
00:51:58,898 --> 00:51:59,986
Yeah.

1014
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:02,727

What's wrong?

1037
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:41,712
She doesn't mean it.
I'll talk to her.

1038
00:54:41,713 --> 00:54:44,105
- She does, Andrew. She does.
- Millie, come here.

1039
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:45,672
She wants
to destroy my life,

1040
00:54:45,673 --> 00:54:47,065
and I don't know why.

1041
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:49,720
No, she doesn't.
I will talk to her.

1042
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:52,026
Andrew, I know you think
that I can do better,

1043
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:54,072
but I need this job.

Nina's coming home early.

1078
00:57:05,857 --> 00:57:07,424
So we have to beat her home.

1079
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,557
We should get going.

1080
00:57:11,297 --> 00:57:12,646
- Okay.
- Okay?

1081
00:57:14,735 --> 00:57:16,562
This is gonna sound
really cheesy,

1082
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:19,827
but I didn't think anybody
could look so beautiful
in the morning.

1083
00:57:30,098 --> 00:57:31,491
Nina can't ever know.

1084
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:35,625
And this can't
ever happen again.

1085
00:57:35,626 --> 00:57:37,584
I really wish
things were different.

1086
00:57:39,194 --> 00:57:41,458
I wish I would have
met you before.

1087
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:43,808
Me too.

1088
00:57:44,504 --> 00:57:45,505
Are you okay?

1089
00:57:46,114 --> 00:57:47,289
Yeah.

1090
00:58:16,623 --> 00:58:17,972
Nina?

1091
00:58:23,238 --> 00:58:24,413
Nina!

1092
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:29,592
I'm gonna go get changed.

1093
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:32,247
I'll start making lunch
just in case she comes back.

1094
00:58:50,048 --> 00:58:51,832
Ah, fuck it.

1095
00:59:17,379 --> 00:59:18,424
Hello?

1096
00:59:21,166 --> 00:59:22,254
Anybody home?

1097
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,739
Hi.

1098
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:31,697
Welcome home.

1099
00:59:31,698 --> 00:59:34,440
- Thank you.
- Lunch is almost ready.

1100
00:59:34,962 --> 00:59:36,790
Oh, boy.

1101
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:40,140
- Hi.
- Hey, sweetheart.

1102
00:59:40,141 --> 00:59:43,187
- Hi. What are you doing?
- I was just fixing the drain

1103
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:45,668
in the upstairs guest bathroom.
It's a bit clogged.

1104
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,278
I knew you would
try to do that.

1105
00:59:47,279 --> 00:59:48,888
I said the plumber's coming
on Tuesday.

1106
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,498
No, I know. I was just
feeling extra manly today.

1107
00:59:50,499 --> 00:59:52,675
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1108
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:54,198
How was the trip? How's Cece?

1109
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:55,679
She's good.

1110
00:59:57,115 --> 00:59:59,072
Listen.

1111
00:59:59,073 --> 01:00:00,640
I'm very sorry
about last night.

1112
01:00:01,946 --> 01:00:03,555
It was a very long drive.

1113
01:00:03,556 --> 01:00:05,122
I was very tired.

1114
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:07,167
I do not sleep well in hotels,

1115
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:08,560
turns out.

1116
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:11,084
And I should not be left alone
with my phone.

1117
01:00:11,085 --> 01:00:14,871
So, lesson learned.
It's a new day.

1118
01:00:14,872 --> 01:00:17,395
- Please accept my apologies.
- Yeah, it's okay.

1119
01:00:17,396 --> 01:00:19,397
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

1120
01:00:19,398 --> 01:00:21,312
Let's get some food in ya.

1121
01:00:21,313 --> 01:00:22,530
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1122
01:00:22,531 --> 01:00:24,708
- Mm. Mm.
- Hi.

1123
01:00:25,752 --> 01:00:27,624
- This looks fantastic.
- Yes.

1124
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:33,716
...you know? Hey, Millie.

1125
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:36,284
- Mm-hmm.
- How was your night off?

1126
01:00:37,808 --> 01:00:40,461
Uh, my best friend Lexi
took me

1127
01:00:40,462 --> 01:00:42,986
- to Peter Luger.
- Hmm.

1128
01:00:42,987 --> 01:00:44,944
Um, she had a gift certificate.
It was really nice.

1129
01:00:44,945 --> 01:00:46,685
We had a lot of sides.

1130
01:00:47,992 --> 01:00:49,949
But I don't really eat meat.

1131
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,343
This looks incredible.
So, thank you.

1132
01:00:52,344 --> 01:00:55,912
I don't know why
but my quiches never turn out.

1133
01:00:55,913 --> 01:00:57,435
I've been meaning to ask you.

1134
01:00:57,436 --> 01:00:59,524
Did you learn how to cook
while you were in prison?

1135
01:01:02,615 --> 01:01:04,398
You know, she was in prison
for ten years

1136
01:01:04,399 --> 01:01:06,097
before she came to
work with us.

1137
01:01:07,185 --> 01:01:08,534
Right?

1138
01:01:09,622 --> 01:01:10,754
I think it's brave,

1139
01:01:11,885 --> 01:01:15,583
making a new start
in a new town.

1140
01:01:15,584 --> 01:01:18,500
I'm glad that we could be
a part of your journey.

1141
01:01:24,463 --> 01:01:26,725
Oh.

1142
01:01:26,726 --> 01:01:29,206
We need a restock
of all of Cece's favorites

1143
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:30,555
before she gets home.

1144
01:01:30,556 --> 01:01:32,601
You haven't really been
keeping up with that.

1145
01:01:33,385 --> 01:01:36,213
And could you... Sorry.

1146
01:01:36,214 --> 01:01:37,301
Could you use my car

1147
01:01:37,302 --> 01:01:38,650
for running errands
from now on

1148
01:01:38,651 --> 01:01:39,999
until you can save up
to get something nicer?

1149
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,045
I'm afraid yours is becoming

1150
01:01:42,046 --> 01:01:44,657
an unwelcome topic
of conversation. Here you go.

1151
01:01:45,876 --> 01:01:47,355
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1152
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:50,097
You okay?

1153
01:01:51,751 --> 01:01:53,057
Yeah.

1154
01:01:56,843 --> 01:01:58,670
I had it all wrong.

1155
01:01:58,671 --> 01:02:00,280
Nina was never
one of those women

1156
01:02:00,281 --> 01:02:01,586
just going with her gut.

1157
01:02:01,587 --> 01:02:02,761
She knew.

1158
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:04,241
The whole fucking time,

1159
01:02:04,242 --> 01:02:06,504
she knew I needed this job
and couldn't leave,

1160
01:02:06,505 --> 01:02:09,289
no matter how shitty
she made my life.

1161
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:11,466
What kind of bitch
does something like that?

1162
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:15,079
Thanks,
have a good day.

1163
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:19,560
Hello, Millie.

1164
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:22,215
- Hi.
- Is that the newest phone?

1165
01:02:22,216 --> 01:02:24,652
What do you think
of that camera? It's...

1166
01:02:24,653 --> 01:02:26,611
pretty great, right?

1167
01:02:26,612 --> 01:02:28,700
I wouldn't know.
I only use it for work.

1168
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:31,138
Well, still, you're very
trusting.

1169
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:33,270
What do you mean?

1170
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:35,881
Pumpkin, most of the nannies
won't take the phone

1171
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:37,840
'cause they don't want
every text,

1172
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:40,407
every call,
every place you go tracked.

1173
01:02:40,408 --> 01:02:43,019
But, I mean,
you have nothing to hide, so...

1174
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:44,064
good for you.

1175
01:02:45,544 --> 01:02:47,588
And that's
when I realized

1176
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:49,243
that Nina knew everything.

1177
01:02:56,685 --> 01:02:59,035
- Millie Calloway.
- Yeah?

1178
01:02:59,036 --> 01:03:00,732
Hands against the car, please.

1179
01:03:00,733 --> 01:03:02,168
What? Why?

1180
01:03:02,169 --> 01:03:03,735
I said,
"Hands against the car."

1181
01:03:03,736 --> 01:03:05,258
Ow! What did I do?

1182
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:07,695
This car's been
reported stolen.

1183
01:03:07,696 --> 01:03:08,784
What? No.

1184
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,395
No, this is my boss's car.

1185
01:03:44,081 --> 01:03:45,472
Thank you.

1186
01:03:56,223 --> 01:03:57,442
I'm sorry.

1187
01:04:02,012 --> 01:04:05,753
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
the truth about prison.

1188
01:04:05,754 --> 01:04:08,408
I was in high school,
and it was a mistake. And...

1189
01:04:08,409 --> 01:04:10,584
You don't have
to explain anything.

1190
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:12,326
The past is in the past.

1191
01:04:17,331 --> 01:04:18,855
Andrew, she knows.

1192
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:20,857
I know.

1193
01:04:26,906 --> 01:04:28,081
Nina!

1194
01:04:28,821 --> 01:04:30,127
Nina, come down here.

1195
01:04:40,006 --> 01:04:41,834
What the hell kind
of stunt was that?

1196
01:04:46,317 --> 01:04:48,927
I know you took her
to the city.

1197
01:04:48,928 --> 01:04:51,191
I know you used
the hotel room.

1198
01:04:52,018 --> 01:04:53,105
And...

1199
01:04:53,106 --> 01:04:54,760
I know that you fucked her.

1200
01:04:58,459 --> 01:04:59,983
You're imagining things again.

1201
01:05:00,418 --> 01:05:01,549
Oh.

1202
01:05:03,247 --> 01:05:05,379
- Of course I am.
- Yeah.

1203
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,643
I imagine

1204
01:05:09,644 --> 01:05:11,819
your parole officer is going
to be really interested

1205
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:14,388
to know that you
no longer have a job

1206
01:05:15,476 --> 01:05:17,869
or...
...a place to live

1207
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:20,045
and that you stole
thousands of dollars'

1208
01:05:20,046 --> 01:05:22,700
worth of my clothes
out of my closet.

1209
01:05:22,701 --> 01:05:26,182
You told me I could take them.
You said you didn't want them
anymore.

1210
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:27,792
And off to prison you'll go...

1211
01:05:27,793 --> 01:05:29,099
Enough!

1212
01:05:30,013 --> 01:05:31,970
Nina, I don't know

1213
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:33,451
who you are.

1214
01:05:35,105 --> 01:05:37,498
And, quite frankly,
your cruelty,

1215
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:41,153
it makes me sick.

1216
01:05:41,154 --> 01:05:42,807
I'm sorry, Nina,
but I would like you...

1217
01:05:42,808 --> 01:05:44,461
I would like you
to leave.

1218
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,033
- What?
- I can't sit here

1219
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:53,732
and watch you destroy
this poor girl's life.

1220
01:05:54,298 --> 01:05:55,386
I won't allow it.

1221
01:05:56,169 --> 01:05:57,691
Please leave my house.

1222
01:05:57,692 --> 01:05:59,042
Uh...

1223
01:06:00,086 --> 01:06:01,087
Our house.

1224
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:03,610
It's my house.

1225
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:05,177
This is our house.

1226
01:06:05,178 --> 01:06:06,527
My...

1227
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,659
house.

1228
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:09,704
You can't do that.

1229
01:06:10,227 --> 01:06:11,924
Now!

1230
01:06:17,364 --> 01:06:18,365
Please leave now.

1231
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:23,414
Would you like help
packing your things?

1232
01:06:25,198 --> 01:06:26,199
Uh, what?

1233
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:32,727
Would you like help
packing your things?

1234
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:41,562
Fuck you.

1235
01:07:24,518 --> 01:07:25,954
Uh, how we doing?

1236
01:07:28,914 --> 01:07:31,437
I need you to know
that it's not your fault.

1237
01:07:31,438 --> 01:07:33,309
This was a long time coming.

1238
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:36,007
- Okay?
- What about Cece?

1239
01:07:36,008 --> 01:07:38,879
Don't worry. I'm talking
to my lawyers tomorrow.

1240
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,881
I'm gonna get her back here,

1241
01:07:40,882 --> 01:07:42,796
make sure she's safe.

1242
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:46,626
I'll start looking
for a new job.

1243
01:07:46,627 --> 01:07:48,368
What are you talking about?

1244
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:54,373
My parole comes
with conditions.

1245
01:07:54,374 --> 01:07:57,333
I haven't felt this way about
somebody in a very long time,

1246
01:07:57,334 --> 01:07:58,856
possibly ever.

1247
01:07:58,857 --> 01:08:01,381
And I really...
I want to help you out.

1248
01:08:02,774 --> 01:08:05,080
I want to help you out
any way I can.

1249
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,821
I want you
to stay here with me.

1250
01:08:07,822 --> 01:08:09,127

Fuck.

1285
01:09:56,148 --> 01:09:58,454
- What happened?
- Trying to do breakfast in bed,

1286
01:09:58,455 --> 01:09:59,977
and then I saw
the creepy groundskeeper guy

1287
01:09:59,978 --> 01:10:01,848
just staring at me
through the window.

1288
01:10:01,849 --> 01:10:03,676
I've had enough
of that asshole.

1289
01:10:03,677 --> 01:10:05,679
Hey! Hey!

1290
01:10:06,463 --> 01:10:07,464
Come here.

1291
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:12,250
Get your shit
and get out of here. Okay?

1292
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:13,600
We don't need you anymore.

1293
01:10:14,645 --> 01:10:15,907
You're fired.

1294
01:10:16,777 --> 01:10:17,822
Fired!

1295
01:10:19,302 --> 01:10:20,346
Got that?

1296
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:31,748
Fuck that guy, right?

1297
01:10:31,749 --> 01:10:34,533
Never understood why Nina wanted
him around so much.

1298
01:10:34,534 --> 01:10:35,796
I could never stand him.

1299
01:10:37,885 --> 01:10:40,801
I'm sorry. It's your mom's
good china.

1300
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:45,240
It's okay. Come here.

1301
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,287
I don't want you to worry
about cleaning or cooking

1302
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:51,376
or anything like that.

1303
01:10:51,377 --> 01:10:53,249
You could twist my arm.

1304
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,517
Don't throw any of these out.

1305
01:11:01,213 --> 01:11:02,561
Okay?

1306
01:11:02,562 --> 01:11:03,649
Yeah.

1307
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,782
I got a plate guy.

1308
01:11:05,783 --> 01:11:07,392
He's real good
at putting them back together.

1309
01:11:07,393 --> 01:11:08,786
I'm sorry.

1310
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:10,396
It's okay.

1311
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:12,485
You'll learn.

1312
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:32,913
Welcome home.

1313
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:34,915
- Hey.
- Hi.

1314
01:12:41,226 --> 01:12:42,792
The plates are still dirty.

1315
01:12:42,793 --> 01:12:44,924
I didn't want to cut myself
washing them.

1316
01:12:44,925 --> 01:12:47,492
- Oh. Mmm.
- Yeah.

1317
01:12:47,493 --> 01:12:49,581
- And I don't want that.
- Mm-mm.

1318
01:12:49,582 --> 01:12:50,669
Dinner smells really good.

1319
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:52,279
- It does, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

1320
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,846
What do you say we put a pin
in dinner for a little bit?

1321
01:12:53,847 --> 01:12:55,588
- Sure. Yeah.
- Yeah?

1322
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:03,596
How do you feel
about champagne?

1323
01:13:14,346 --> 01:13:16,260
In here, seriously?

1324
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:19,395
Yeah. We'll be acrobatic.

1325
01:13:20,352 --> 01:13:21,788
Bubbles. Bubbles.

1326
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,009
Okay.

1327
01:13:29,796 --> 01:13:30,971
Ready?

1328
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:45,769
Cheers.

1329
01:13:53,298 --> 01:13:54,603
What do you think?

1330
01:13:56,214 --> 01:13:58,346
- You like it?
- It's really bubbly.

1331
01:14:43,653 --> 01:14:44,915
Andrew?

1332
01:14:59,582 --> 01:15:01,192
Andrew, I'm stuck.

1333
01:15:04,891 --> 01:15:06,719
Andrew, can you open the door?

1334
01:15:08,155 --> 01:15:10,809
Andrew, can you hear me?
Can you let me out?

1335
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,943
I will.

1336
01:15:13,813 --> 01:15:14,944
Just not yet.

1337
01:15:14,945 --> 01:15:16,380
What... What do you mean?

1338
01:15:16,381 --> 01:15:19,078
What are you talking about,
Andrew? Let me out.

1339
01:15:19,079 --> 01:15:21,211
Andrew, come on.
Is this a game?

1340
01:15:21,212 --> 01:15:22,518
I wish it was.

1341
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:25,128
What?

1342
01:15:25,129 --> 01:15:27,652
What are you talking about?
Andrew, open the door.

1343
01:15:29,133 --> 01:15:32,266
Andrew! Open the door, Andrew!

1344
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:36,444
Andrew, let me out of here!

1345
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:38,968
Let me out of here!

1346
01:15:57,509 --> 01:16:04,255
Oh, my God.
Let's get the hell out of here.

1347
01:16:06,953 --> 01:16:08,780

Dear Cece,

1362
01:16:53,957 --> 01:16:55,784
if you're reading this,

1363
01:16:55,785 --> 01:16:57,220
I'm either dead

1364
01:16:57,221 --> 01:16:58,875
or you just turned 18.

1365
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:02,704
Either way,
I needed you to know

1366
01:17:02,705 --> 01:17:05,664
that your mother was
a fucking idiot.

1367
01:17:06,926 --> 01:17:07,971
Full stop.

1368
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:14,498
What do you expect from
a girl whose parents died
when she was eight

1369
01:17:14,499 --> 01:17:17,370
and spent the rest
of her childhood
in shitty foster homes?

1370
01:17:17,371 --> 01:17:18,763
I did not,

1371
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:20,896
as Andrew likes to insinuate,

1372
01:17:20,897 --> 01:17:22,724
have anything to do

1373
01:17:22,725 --> 01:17:25,074
with that fire
that killed them.

1374
01:17:25,075 --> 01:17:27,598
I love my parents more than
anything in the world,

1375
01:17:27,599 --> 01:17:28,991
and for a long time,

1376
01:17:28,992 --> 01:17:30,994
I wish I'd gone
right up with them.

1377
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,343
But I didn't.

1378
01:17:33,344 --> 01:17:34,867
So I had to keep living.

1379
01:17:36,303 --> 01:17:38,087
Abandonment issues,

1380
01:17:38,088 --> 01:17:39,697
trust issues,

1381
01:17:39,698 --> 01:17:41,090
self-esteem issues.

1382
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:43,005
I filled the whole bingo card.

1383
01:17:43,006 --> 01:17:45,703
I'm not sure if it was
a miracle or just dumb luck

1384
01:17:45,704 --> 01:17:47,226
that I survived my childhood,

1385
01:17:47,227 --> 01:17:49,402
but I eventually
scholarshipped my way

1386
01:17:49,403 --> 01:17:51,535
into law school.

1387
01:17:51,536 --> 01:17:54,103
And I almost made it
to the other side.

1388
01:17:54,104 --> 01:17:55,539
Almost.

1389
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:58,237
But there was
that married professor

1390
01:17:58,238 --> 01:17:59,370
who knocked me up.

1391
01:18:01,285 --> 01:18:03,069
He didn't want anything
to do with us.

1392
01:18:05,289 --> 01:18:07,856
Sometimes I think about
that law degree I bailed on,

1393
01:18:07,857 --> 01:18:11,076
whether it would have made
a difference in the end.

1394
01:18:12,731 --> 01:18:13,818
Nina, get in here

1395
01:18:13,819 --> 01:18:15,515
with the Grady spreadsheets.

1396
01:18:15,516 --> 01:18:16,561
Coming.

1397
01:18:18,084 --> 01:18:19,781
Is there a way
I can get some of her money?

1398
01:18:19,782 --> 01:18:20,869
Well, you're asking yourself,

1399
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:22,522
"Will this arbitration
ever end?"

1400
01:18:22,523 --> 01:18:23,610
- There they are.
- Hi.

1401
01:18:23,611 --> 01:18:25,701
Jesus Christ, Nina!

1402
01:18:26,919 --> 01:18:28,659
Go clean yourself up.

1403
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:29,921
God.

1404
01:18:29,922 --> 01:18:31,663
Oh, sorry.

1405
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:33,926
What the fuck?

1406
01:18:34,492 --> 01:18:36,406
Right?

1407
01:18:36,407 --> 01:18:38,234
It's amazing
what you'll trade away

1408
01:18:38,235 --> 01:18:40,323
for the sweet relief
of health insurance

1409
01:18:40,324 --> 01:18:41,455
and child care.

1410
01:18:42,979 --> 01:18:45,721
And it was that exact moment...

1411
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:49,376
he came into my life.

1412
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,944
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry about Lynch.

1413
01:18:52,945 --> 01:18:55,381
The guy can be a real asshole.

1414
01:18:55,382 --> 01:18:56,948
That's why he's my lawyer.

1415
01:18:56,949 --> 01:18:58,471
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

1416
01:18:58,472 --> 01:19:00,909
Uh, no, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm okay.

1417
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:03,041
I just feel really bad
about what happened,

1418
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:04,695
and I'd love
to take you to lunch.

1419
01:19:04,696 --> 01:19:06,349
Oh, you don't have to do that.

1420
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:07,481
I want to.

1421
01:19:08,526 --> 01:19:09,961
At the time,

1422
01:19:09,962 --> 01:19:12,659
I thought he was
so goddamn charming,

1423
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:14,836
humble, handsome,

1424
01:19:14,837 --> 01:19:16,403
a million-dollar smile.

1425
01:19:18,928 --> 01:19:21,494
- Mmm.
- Um...

1426
01:19:21,495 --> 01:19:24,062
Hey, I was thinking maybe
we could go out sometime.

1427
01:19:24,063 --> 01:19:27,022
My mother loves children.
She could babysit.

1428
01:19:27,023 --> 01:19:29,677
Or, of course, your daughter
could come with us.

1429
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:32,592
I would love that.

1430
01:19:32,593 --> 01:19:35,030
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1431
01:19:35,031 --> 01:19:38,860
It took him six days
to get in my pants

1432
01:19:38,861 --> 01:19:40,557
and six weeks to propose.

1433
01:19:40,558 --> 01:19:41,776
Oh, my God.

1434
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:42,864
Are you kidding me?

1435
01:19:42,865 --> 01:19:44,996
Andrew!

1436
01:19:44,997 --> 01:19:47,782
Honestly, I would have
said yes halfway through
that first fucking lunch.

1437
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,742
How was I supposed to resist
a knight in shining armor?

1438
01:19:52,396 --> 01:19:54,919
The house should
have been a tip-off.

1439
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,616
A storybook kingdom he built

1440
01:19:56,617 --> 01:19:59,489
for some mysterious fiancee
named Kathy,

1441
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:01,056
who jilted him.

1442
01:20:01,057 --> 01:20:02,927
I should have asked
what happened to her,

1443
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:04,059
but I didn't.

1444
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:05,191
"Her loss," I thought.

1445
01:20:07,063 --> 01:20:08,933
Wow.

1446
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:11,893
Something smells amazing!
What is that?

1447
01:20:11,894 --> 01:20:13,198
I think
what you're smelling is

1448
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:15,244
the vanilla cardamom
coffee cake I just made,

1449
01:20:15,245 --> 01:20:16,462
and you're gonna be
my guinea pig.

1450
01:20:16,463 --> 01:20:18,987
Oh, I'd love to be.

1451
01:20:18,988 --> 01:20:20,249
I hate to break it to you,
sweetheart,

1452
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,773
but your roots are
making a break for it.

1453
01:20:22,774 --> 01:20:25,689
Well, good news, I just made
a salon appointment with Mark,

1454
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:27,169
and he's gonna beat them
back in today.

1455
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:29,127
Mmm.

1456
01:20:29,128 --> 01:20:31,565
I love Mark for that.

1457
01:20:35,221 --> 01:20:36,787
Andy, hi.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1458
01:20:36,788 --> 01:20:39,398
Oh, that's okay.

1459
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:42,140
Stopped by
that Thai place you like.

1460
01:20:42,141 --> 01:20:43,402
Want me
to make you a cocktail?

1461
01:20:43,403 --> 01:20:46,015
- There she is. Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

1462
01:20:58,114 --> 01:20:59,201
Was someone a silly goose

1463
01:20:59,202 --> 01:21:00,463
and forget
to get their roots done?

1464
01:21:00,464 --> 01:21:02,726
Mmm. Mm. Mm.

1465
01:21:02,727 --> 01:21:04,119
I got caught
at the park with Cece

1466
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:06,730
before I dropped her off
at Lena's. I'm sorry.

1467
01:21:06,731 --> 01:21:08,297
I'm gonna reschedule

1468
01:21:08,298 --> 01:21:09,864
and get this stuff
on the table.

1469
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:12,257
Hey, before you do that...

1470
01:21:12,258 --> 01:21:14,521
you think you can give me
a hand with something?

1471
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:19,395
What?

1472
01:21:19,396 --> 01:21:21,788
I just have this last-minute
meeting with the board,

1473
01:21:21,789 --> 01:21:23,834
and there's these notes.
I cannot seem to find them.

1474
01:21:23,835 --> 01:21:25,749
I think they're upstairs
in the storage room.

1475
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:26,837
- Right now?
- Yeah.

1476
01:21:26,838 --> 01:21:28,578
- Yeah.
- Can you give me a hand?

1477
01:21:28,579 --> 01:21:30,754
- You know it.
- Thank you.

1478
01:21:30,755 --> 01:21:32,103
Ah.

1479
01:21:32,104 --> 01:21:33,845
I'll go turn the light on.

1480
01:21:34,585 --> 01:21:35,977
I'll be right up.

1481
01:21:35,978 --> 01:21:37,457
Okay.

1482
01:22:04,223 --> 01:22:06,486
- Babe, there's no files in here.
- I know.

1483
01:22:07,096 --> 01:22:08,271
Babe.

1484
01:22:19,282 --> 01:22:20,544
Andy.

1485
01:22:21,371 --> 01:22:23,676
Andy?

1486
01:22:23,677 --> 01:22:25,113
I'm here.

1487
01:22:25,114 --> 01:22:27,202
Andy, it's locked.

1488
01:22:27,203 --> 01:22:29,247
I am very disappointed, Nina.

1489
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:32,381
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1490
01:22:32,382 --> 01:22:36,472
Your hair is a privilege
and it needs to be cared for.

1491
01:22:38,475 --> 01:22:39,606
Um...

1492
01:22:40,738 --> 01:22:42,652
My hair?

1493
01:22:42,653 --> 01:22:44,306
Are you aware
of how embarrassing it is

1494
01:22:44,307 --> 01:22:47,309
to have your wife walking around
town with her roots showing?

1495
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:49,920
I'm gonna make
another appointment,

1496
01:22:49,921 --> 01:22:51,182
I told ya.

1497
01:22:51,183 --> 01:22:53,793
I need you to be better.

1498
01:22:53,794 --> 01:22:55,839
For the both of us.
I really do.

1499
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,799
Andy, I'm gonna get
my fucking roots fixed, okay?

1500
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,019
So you can let me out
of the room now, please.

1501
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:03,368
I will.

1502
01:23:03,369 --> 01:23:05,631
Just not yet.

1503
01:23:05,632 --> 01:23:09,070
I need you to understand
that there are consequences
to your actions.

1504
01:23:09,071 --> 01:23:11,463
What are you
fucking talking about?

1505
01:23:11,464 --> 01:23:14,511
I have an envelope, which I will
be sliding under the door.

1506
01:23:17,514 --> 01:23:19,906
Now, listen
very carefully, please.

1507
01:23:19,907 --> 01:23:22,040
I need you to...

1508
01:23:22,606 --> 01:23:25,129
pluck 100 hairs

1509
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:28,480
from your scalp
with the roots intact.

1510
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:30,047
- Um, what?
- Nina,

1511
01:23:30,048 --> 01:23:32,180
I need to see those follicles.

1512
01:23:32,181 --> 01:23:33,746
Okay, babe, you got me.

1513
01:23:33,747 --> 01:23:35,706
That was good.

1514
01:23:37,142 --> 01:23:38,230
You got me.

1515
01:23:38,926 --> 01:23:40,318
Please let me out.

1516
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:42,320
Once you've done that,

1517
01:23:42,321 --> 01:23:44,192
please put them back
in the envelope

1518
01:23:44,193 --> 01:23:45,584
and slide it under the door,

1519
01:23:45,585 --> 01:23:47,412
and then we can discuss
your freedom.

1520
01:23:47,413 --> 01:23:48,848
Andy!

1521
01:23:48,849 --> 01:23:50,112
This isn't funny!

1522
01:23:51,287 --> 01:23:53,853
Andy!

1523
01:23:53,854 --> 01:23:55,246
I'm not doing this anymore.

1524
01:23:55,247 --> 01:23:57,727
Please let me out
of the fucking room!

1525
01:23:57,728 --> 01:23:59,120
I'm so sorry.

1526
01:23:59,121 --> 01:24:02,123
Andy.

1527
01:24:02,124 --> 01:24:03,473
And I love you so much.

1528
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,083
Babe?

1529
01:24:05,953 --> 01:24:07,171
Babe?

1530
01:24:08,608 --> 01:24:10,305
Andy?

1531
01:24:10,306 --> 01:24:12,263
Andy!

1532
01:24:12,264 --> 01:24:15,659
Cece! Andy! Please!

1533
01:24:16,225 --> 01:24:17,269
Fuck!

1534
01:24:20,707 --> 01:24:22,666
Who was
this man I married?

1535
01:24:24,494 --> 01:24:26,061
What had I done

1536
01:24:26,844 --> 01:24:28,106
to deserve this?

1537
01:24:30,587 --> 01:24:32,631
No food.

1538
01:24:32,632 --> 01:24:35,504
Three tiny bottles of water.

1539
01:24:35,505 --> 01:24:39,638
The only bathroom was
a bucket in the closet.

1540
01:24:39,639 --> 01:24:42,250
I thought back to when it was
just me and you, Cece.

1541
01:24:42,251 --> 01:24:45,080
I had no idea
how good we had it.

1542
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:51,086
Even if we were constantly
on the brink
of financial disaster.

1543
01:24:53,175 --> 01:24:55,090
Now what choice did I have

1544
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,701
but to obey this fucker

1545
01:24:59,442 --> 01:25:01,052
if I ever wanted
to see you again?

1546
01:25:50,928 --> 01:25:52,147
Andrew,

1547
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:55,975
I did everything
that you asked me to do.

1548
01:25:55,976 --> 01:25:57,673
Can you let me out, please?

1549
01:25:57,674 --> 01:26:00,632
One of the strands didn't
have a follicle,

1550
01:26:00,633 --> 01:26:02,156
so you have to start again.

1551
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,809
What?

1552
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:05,420
Andrew, Andrew, please.

1553
01:26:05,421 --> 01:26:07,379
Please be more careful
this time.

1554
01:26:09,599 --> 01:26:11,556
Andrew! Please!

1555
01:26:11,557 --> 01:26:13,516
Please!
Andrew, please!

1556
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,779
Andrew!

1557
01:26:27,921 --> 01:26:30,620
Oh... ...fuck!

1558
01:26:48,855 --> 01:26:50,422
This was for your own good.

1559
01:26:52,119 --> 01:26:53,294
If you'd let me,

1560
01:26:53,295 --> 01:26:55,166
I can help you
become a better person.

1561
01:26:56,428 --> 01:26:57,560
Mmm.

1562
01:27:01,564 --> 01:27:03,130
Cece.

1563
01:27:04,523 --> 01:27:05,829
Cece!

1564
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:15,665
Oh, baby, hi. Hi, come here.
Come here.

1565
01:28:07,717 --> 01:28:08,761
Oh.

1566
01:28:25,909 --> 01:28:26,997
Cece!

1567
01:28:29,086 --> 01:28:31,348
No!

1568
01:28:31,349 --> 01:28:33,351
Cece!

1569
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:52,021
If I were the police,
maybe I would have
thought the same thing,

1570
01:28:52,022 --> 01:28:55,459
that I had drugged
and tried to drown my baby,

1571
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:57,287
that I had swallowed
a bottle of pills

1572
01:28:57,288 --> 01:28:59,289
and tried to off myself, too.

1573
01:29:06,689 --> 01:29:12,302
No one would
believe my husband was
a cruel, sadistic monster.

1574
01:29:12,303 --> 01:29:14,957
How could a man that handsome,
that successful,

1575
01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:18,353
that well-loved
be anything but a saint?

1576
01:29:20,267 --> 01:29:24,749
There is nothing in that attic
except boxes and papers, Nina.

1577
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:27,666
When you're having delusions,
they can feel very real,

1578
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:30,364
even when they're not.

1579
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:34,063
While they pumped me
full of antipsychotics,
antidepressants,

1580
01:29:34,064 --> 01:29:36,109
all I could think about
was you.

1581
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,156
After nine months,

1582
01:29:40,157 --> 01:29:42,201
I realized the only way
to get back to you

1583
01:29:42,202 --> 01:29:44,116
was to admit...

1584
01:29:44,117 --> 01:29:46,902
what I'd done.
So, I fell on my knees,

1585
01:29:46,903 --> 01:29:50,732
confessed everything
and begged for my freedom.

1586
01:29:50,733 --> 01:29:52,778
We're gonna be so happy, Nina.

1587
01:29:53,779 --> 01:29:55,738
As long as you follow
the rules.

1588
01:30:35,168 --> 01:30:37,039
But by that time,

1589
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,868
I understood
I'd never be free.

1590
01:30:39,869 --> 01:30:41,652
No matter
how hard I tried to prove

1591
01:30:41,653 --> 01:30:43,915
I was the happiest,
most perfect wife...

1592
01:30:43,916 --> 01:30:46,135
...in the entire world,

1593
01:30:46,136 --> 01:30:47,528
Andrew had convinced

1594
01:30:47,529 --> 01:30:51,836
all those adoring
shit-for-brain vipers

1595
01:30:51,837 --> 01:30:53,185
that I was crazy,

1596
01:30:53,186 --> 01:30:55,797
dangerous, unfit
to raise my own daughter.

1597
01:30:55,798 --> 01:30:58,539
And he was crowned
Husband of the Year

1598
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:00,933
for sticking
by his unhinged wife.

1599
01:31:02,282 --> 01:31:04,501
Of course,
he wanted his own baby.

1600
01:31:04,502 --> 01:31:06,198
But there was no way

1601
01:31:06,199 --> 01:31:07,983
I was gonna let him plant

1602
01:31:07,984 --> 01:31:10,376
his evil seed in me.

1603
01:31:10,377 --> 01:31:12,727
I snuck away to the city,
got an IUD,

1604
01:31:12,728 --> 01:31:15,991
the same doctor I eventually
blackmailed to lie

1605
01:31:15,992 --> 01:31:20,082
and tell Andrew
that I was fresh out of eggs.

1606
01:31:20,083 --> 01:31:22,606
Anything was an excuse
to lock me up.

1607
01:31:22,607 --> 01:31:24,173
Leaving the lights on,

1608
01:31:24,174 --> 01:31:26,480
when you spilled your juice
at the breakfast table.

1609
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:28,307
And any time I fought back,

1610
01:31:28,308 --> 01:31:33,487
he made sure to remind me
that he held all the cards.

1611
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:36,533
Enzo was my only connection
to the outside world,

1612
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:38,753
the only one who believed me.

1613
01:31:38,754 --> 01:31:40,755
He tried to help us escape.

1614
01:31:40,756 --> 01:31:42,321
He got us fake passports,

1615
01:31:42,322 --> 01:31:44,236
but Andrew found them
in my drawer

1616
01:31:44,237 --> 01:31:46,544
and back to the institution
I went.

1617
01:31:48,067 --> 01:31:49,590
Every asset was in his name.

1618
01:31:49,591 --> 01:31:52,331
I had no money, no credit,
no family, no friends.

1619
01:31:52,332 --> 01:31:54,203
I was
a psych ward frequent flier

1620
01:31:54,204 --> 01:31:56,119
with zero chance at custody.

1621
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,555
If I tried to run,

1622
01:31:58,556 --> 01:32:01,427
Andrew would hunt me down
and drag us back,

1623
01:32:01,428 --> 01:32:03,560
and everyone would
call him a hero.

1624
01:32:03,561 --> 01:32:05,344
I was trapped.

1625
01:32:05,345 --> 01:32:06,868
There was no chance in hell

1626
01:32:06,869 --> 01:32:09,305
he would ever let me leave
the marriage alive.

1627
01:32:09,306 --> 01:32:11,133
And if I died,

1628
01:32:11,134 --> 01:32:12,439
what would become of you?

1629
01:32:13,049 --> 01:32:15,137
What had I done

1630
01:32:15,138 --> 01:32:16,878
bringing this man

1631
01:32:16,879 --> 01:32:18,402
into your life?

1632
01:32:19,577 --> 01:32:21,186
And then it dawned on me.

1633
01:32:21,187 --> 01:32:23,233
Andrew did have a weakness,

1634
01:32:23,929 --> 01:32:25,844
his need to be adored.

1635
01:32:29,369 --> 01:32:31,676
So I started making a plan.

1636
01:32:34,636 --> 01:32:36,725
- You went away again.
- I know.

1637
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:39,465
And now I'm back.

1638
01:32:39,466 --> 01:32:41,425
Andrew found
the passports.

1639
01:32:43,732 --> 01:32:47,430
Look, I know a guy
who could help.

1640
01:32:47,431 --> 01:32:49,912
I think that would only
make things worse for me.

1641
01:32:50,477 --> 01:32:51,869
I could help you.

1642
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:53,915
You need to stay
out of this, Enzo.

1643
01:32:53,916 --> 01:32:56,004
Listen to me carefully.

1644
01:32:56,005 --> 01:32:59,268
All right? I lost a sister
to a man like Andrew,

1645
01:32:59,269 --> 01:33:01,966
and I will not let
this happen again.

1646
01:33:01,967 --> 01:33:04,708
So now you go,
you pack your bag,

1647
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:07,015
you take Cece,
and you leave right now.

1648
01:33:07,016 --> 01:33:08,844
I will take care of Andrew.

1649
01:33:09,322 --> 01:33:10,454
No,

1650
01:33:11,107 --> 01:33:12,587
Andrew's gonna leave me.

1651
01:33:14,632 --> 01:33:15,633
How?

1652
01:33:20,029 --> 01:33:21,986
Millie was
exactly Andrew's type.

1653
01:33:21,987 --> 01:33:25,207
Pretty, smart, blonde,

1654
01:33:25,208 --> 01:33:29,603
all alone in the world,
someone he'd want to save.

1655
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:32,954
Disowned by her parents,
fired from her last job,

1656
01:33:32,955 --> 01:33:35,696
broke, no friends,
living in her car,

1657
01:33:35,697 --> 01:33:37,262
and the crown jewel,

1658
01:33:37,263 --> 01:33:38,742
out on parole

1659
01:33:38,743 --> 01:33:42,006
after serving ten years
of a 15 year sentence.

1660
01:33:42,007 --> 01:33:44,705
And not for drugs
or drunk driving

1661
01:33:44,706 --> 01:33:46,055
or some other teen bullshit.

1662
01:33:47,273 --> 01:33:50,145
She was in prison for murder.

1663
01:33:50,146 --> 01:33:52,975
My plan was to hire
a pretty girl to replace me.

1664
01:33:54,411 --> 01:33:57,108
But once I met Millie,

1665
01:33:57,109 --> 01:33:59,068
I came up with a better plan.

1666
01:34:06,118 --> 01:34:08,119
Enzo begged me
to find another way,

1667
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:10,556
to leave Millie
out of all this, but...

1668
01:34:10,557 --> 01:34:13,951
I knew it was the only way
I could truly be free
from Andrew.

1669
01:34:13,952 --> 01:34:16,606
I made him promise
not to interfere.

1670
01:34:16,607 --> 01:34:18,653
It was her
or it was Cece and me.

1671
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,958
He reluctantly agreed,

1672
01:34:20,959 --> 01:34:23,309
but he said he would stay
to keep an eye on her.

1673
01:34:25,311 --> 01:34:27,399
Part of me hopes
you'll never read this.

1674
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:29,010
But if you do,

1675
01:34:29,011 --> 01:34:31,360
I'm glad you know
the whole story now.

1676
01:34:31,361 --> 01:34:35,059
I just needed you to know
I wasn't a bad person.

1677
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:38,323
Hiring Millie was the only way
I could keep you safe

1678
01:34:38,324 --> 01:34:39,629
and set us both free,

1679
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:41,283
if we get lucky enough

1680
01:34:41,284 --> 01:34:43,981
to make it
all the way to free.

1681
01:34:43,982 --> 01:34:47,419
And I figured if anyone could
take care of this situation,

1682
01:34:47,420 --> 01:34:48,943
it was her.

1683
01:35:00,738 --> 01:35:02,565
- Millie.
- Ah!

1684
01:35:02,566 --> 01:35:03,828
Millie, please stop.

1685
01:35:04,307 --> 01:35:05,395
Please?

1686
01:35:07,832 --> 01:35:09,006
Open the door.

1687
01:35:09,007 --> 01:35:10,791
- I can't do that.
- Why not? Come on.

1688
01:35:10,792 --> 01:35:12,054
I will.

1689
01:35:12,881 --> 01:35:13,925
Just not yet.

1690
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:17,449
Andrew, what the fuck
do you want?

1691
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:19,017
It's irreplaceable, Millie.

1692
01:35:19,626 --> 01:35:21,323
What?

1693
01:35:21,324 --> 01:35:23,455
My grandmother,
she brought this china

1694
01:35:23,456 --> 01:35:24,675
all the way from London.

1695
01:35:25,197 --> 01:35:27,242
And my mother,

1696
01:35:27,243 --> 01:35:30,375
she served every single
holiday meal on it

1697
01:35:30,376 --> 01:35:32,552
with not so much
as a single chip.

1698
01:35:33,379 --> 01:35:36,556
And then you drop it.

1699
01:35:37,427 --> 01:35:39,124
Like a careless child,

1700
01:35:39,603 --> 01:35:40,952
you drop it.

1701
01:35:41,605 --> 01:35:43,301
And on top of that,

1702
01:35:43,302 --> 01:35:45,608
you don't even clean it.

1703
01:35:45,609 --> 01:35:48,263
It was an accident, Andrew.

1704
01:35:48,264 --> 01:35:50,701
Family heirlooms are
a privilege, Millie.

1705
01:35:52,181 --> 01:35:54,835
And now one of mine
is in 21 pieces,

1706
01:35:54,836 --> 01:35:58,577
and you didn't even clean it.

1707
01:35:58,578 --> 01:36:00,188
Let me out,

1708
01:36:00,189 --> 01:36:01,972
you're a fucking psychopath!

1709
01:36:01,973 --> 01:36:04,583
I will let you out,
But first, you need to atone.

1710
01:36:04,584 --> 01:36:06,194
So what you're gonna do...

1711
01:36:06,195 --> 01:36:08,326
...is you're gonna take this
piece right here in my hand,

1712
01:36:08,327 --> 01:36:10,938
and you're gonna carve
21 lines into your stomach,

1713
01:36:10,939 --> 01:36:13,115
one for every piece
that you fucking broke.

1714
01:36:19,643 --> 01:36:20,861
Once you've done that,

1715
01:36:20,862 --> 01:36:22,863
we can discuss your freedom.

1716
01:36:22,864 --> 01:36:24,429
If...

1717
01:36:24,430 --> 01:36:25,735
you don't do it properly,

1718
01:36:25,736 --> 01:36:27,781
you are just going
to have to do it again.

1719
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:30,000
So I suggest you do it right
the first time.

1720
01:36:30,001 --> 01:36:32,133
In your fucking dreams.

1721
01:36:32,134 --> 01:36:36,267
And I need these to be
long and deep cuts.

1722
01:36:36,268 --> 01:36:39,488
Oh, and please slide the piece
under the door when you're done.

1723
01:36:39,489 --> 01:36:40,882
I'll be watching.

1724
01:36:45,974 --> 01:36:47,105
Andrew?

1725
01:36:51,022 --> 01:36:52,850
Andrew!

1726
01:36:55,592 --> 01:36:57,636
Andrew!

1727
01:36:59,074 --> 01:37:00,683
Andrew!

1728
01:37:03,339 --> 01:37:04,556
It's pretty clear now

1729
01:37:04,557 --> 01:37:05,906
that Nina knew
everything about me

1730
01:37:05,907 --> 01:37:07,691
from the moment
I walked through her door.

1731
01:37:09,301 --> 01:37:10,867
It's funny.

1732
01:37:10,868 --> 01:37:13,653
The boy I went to prison for
was a lot like Andrew.

1733
01:37:14,306 --> 01:37:16,003
Stupid rich,

1734
01:37:16,004 --> 01:37:17,308
good looking,

1735
01:37:17,309 --> 01:37:19,050
adored by everyone.

1736
01:37:19,572 --> 01:37:20,704
A saint.

1737
01:37:33,151 --> 01:37:34,891
Help.

1738
01:37:42,247 --> 01:37:43,508
I didn't mean
to kill him...

1739
01:37:43,509 --> 01:37:46,120
...but I'm not sorry I did.

1740
01:37:46,121 --> 01:37:48,079
Millie,
what did you do?

1741
01:37:49,385 --> 01:37:51,299
Oh, my God, what did you do?

1742
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:52,866
I was trying
to do a good thing,

1743
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:54,563
but my roommate
denied everything.

1744
01:37:54,564 --> 01:37:55,999
I don't know why.

1745
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,261
Everyone believed
the rich kids,

1746
01:37:57,262 --> 01:37:59,220
not the scholarship
charity case.

1747
01:37:59,221 --> 01:38:00,483
Even my parents.

1748
01:38:01,745 --> 01:38:04,225
The only option was
to take a plea deal.

1749
01:38:04,226 --> 01:38:05,574
Manslaughter,

1750
01:38:05,575 --> 01:38:07,010
fifteen years.

1751
01:38:09,057 --> 01:38:11,319
I made parole
after ten.

1752
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:14,844
It wasn't a smooth transition
into the real world.

1753
01:38:14,845 --> 01:38:16,891
I guess I don't handle
creeps very well.

1754
01:38:19,284 --> 01:38:21,416
Keep your hands off us,
Charlie, you fucking freak.

1755
01:38:21,417 --> 01:38:23,767
Nina was looking
for an escape hatch.

1756
01:38:24,333 --> 01:38:25,377
I was it.

1757
01:38:26,422 --> 01:38:27,727
Good for her, I guess.

1758
01:38:28,990 --> 01:38:30,817
Now I'm the butterfly
in the box.

1759
01:38:33,168 --> 01:38:35,126
All those years I persisted,

1760
01:38:35,779 --> 01:38:37,519
I survived,

1761
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,564
I fought back.

1762
01:38:39,696 --> 01:38:41,349
But in the end,

1763
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:43,526
there's only one way out
for girls like me.

1764
01:38:45,049 --> 01:38:47,312
Surrender
and hope for the best.

1765
01:39:25,263 --> 01:39:27,134
Andrew, I did it!

1766
01:39:27,135 --> 01:39:29,267
Andrew, you can
let me out now!

1767
01:39:46,676 --> 01:39:47,720
I had two days left.

1768
01:39:49,548 --> 01:39:50,593
I know,

1769
01:39:51,202 --> 01:39:52,203
but we have to go.

1770
01:39:54,423 --> 01:39:55,727
Where?

1771
01:39:55,728 --> 01:39:58,252
We are gonna find
somewhere new to live.

1772
01:39:58,253 --> 01:39:59,515
Just the two of us.

1773
01:40:03,084 --> 01:40:04,476
We're free.

1774
01:40:10,221 --> 01:40:11,440
What?

1775
01:40:13,181 --> 01:40:14,530
What?

1776
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:16,619
What about Millie?

1777
01:40:18,447 --> 01:40:21,015
Millie's... gonna
stay with Daddy.

1778
01:40:23,669 --> 01:40:25,845
I think we should
take her with us.

1779
01:40:30,154 --> 01:40:31,721
Millie can take care
of herself.

1780
01:41:11,195 --> 01:41:12,936
Good morning, sleepyhead.

1781
01:41:14,503 --> 01:41:15,634
How are you?

1782
01:41:16,287 --> 01:41:17,288
I'm okay.

1783
01:41:19,943 --> 01:41:21,814
I really do want
a life with you.

1784
01:41:23,468 --> 01:41:24,556
I really do.

1785
01:41:26,776 --> 01:41:28,168
You just need to learn

1786
01:41:28,169 --> 01:41:30,170
that there's consequences

1787
01:41:30,171 --> 01:41:31,476
to your actions.

1788
01:41:44,141 --> 01:41:46,099
Think about it.

1789
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:49,102
You'll have everything
you've ever wanted.

1790
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:52,323
An education,
financial stability,

1791
01:41:53,759 --> 01:41:54,978
a beautiful home,

1792
01:41:56,327 --> 01:41:57,328
a family.

1793
01:41:58,764 --> 01:42:00,114
Isn't that what you want?

1794
01:42:03,552 --> 01:42:05,467
I do want those things.

1795
01:42:07,947 --> 01:42:08,992
So do I.

1796
01:42:12,909 --> 01:42:14,475
Just not with you, asshole.

1797
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,089
God! God damn!

1798
01:42:23,398 --> 01:42:25,747
Millie, come here!

1799
01:42:30,056 --> 01:42:32,101
No, Millie. No!

1800
01:42:32,102 --> 01:42:34,757
Millie! Fuck! Millie!

1801
01:42:35,366 --> 01:42:36,671
Come on!

1802
01:42:36,672 --> 01:42:38,847
Open the fucking door! Now!

1803
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:41,806
I am going to call the cops

1804
01:42:41,807 --> 01:42:44,592
and you're gonna rot
in fucking prison.

1805
01:42:44,593 --> 01:42:46,334
Open the fucking door!

1806
01:42:50,729 --> 01:42:51,861
Fuck!

1807
01:42:53,515 --> 01:42:54,690
Let me out!

1808
01:42:56,692 --> 01:42:58,346
I need a fucking sandwich.

1809
01:42:58,911 --> 01:43:00,086
Open the door!

1810
01:43:04,265 --> 01:43:06,876
Let me the fuck out!

1811
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,617

Millie.

1831
01:44:55,071 --> 01:44:56,290
Millie, are you there?

1832
01:44:56,899 --> 01:44:57,943
I'm here.

1833
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:01,555
I'm so sorry, Millie.

1834
01:45:01,556 --> 01:45:02,948
I really fucked up.

1835
01:45:06,996 --> 01:45:08,650
I did a really terrible thing.

1836
01:45:13,219 --> 01:45:15,700
I just have such
a bad temper sometimes.

1837
01:45:16,484 --> 01:45:17,746
But I want to be better.

1838
01:45:19,661 --> 01:45:21,226
I know I can be better.

1839
01:45:21,227 --> 01:45:23,141
I want you
to help me be better.

1840
01:45:23,142 --> 01:45:24,578
I need somebody to help me.

1841
01:45:24,579 --> 01:45:27,842
Can you open
this door, please?

1842
01:45:27,843 --> 01:45:30,235
I'm so thirsty. Can you please
open the door

1843
01:45:30,236 --> 01:45:32,150
so I can get some water?

1844
01:45:32,151 --> 01:45:33,283
I will.

1845
01:45:34,502 --> 01:45:35,503
You will?

1846
01:45:36,634 --> 01:45:37,940
Yeah.

1847
01:45:39,942 --> 01:45:41,422
Just not yet.

1848
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,602
I want you to do
something for me first.

1849
01:45:51,562 --> 01:45:53,129
What do you need me to do?

1850
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,405
I need you to pull out
your front tooth.

1851
01:46:11,103 --> 01:46:12,669
What?

1852
01:46:12,670 --> 01:46:15,106
I think it would be good
for you to be without that smile

1853
01:46:15,107 --> 01:46:17,370
that makes all the bitches
in the neighborhood

1854
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:21,679
just fall under
your fucking toxic spell,

1855
01:46:23,507 --> 01:46:25,203
to be without that smile

1856
01:46:25,204 --> 01:46:27,381
that your mother loves
so much.

1857
01:46:31,515 --> 01:46:33,516
Millie, I'm not doing that.

1858
01:46:33,517 --> 01:46:34,822
I thought you said
you wanted my help,

1859
01:46:34,823 --> 01:46:35,997
and I was here
offering it to you,

1860
01:46:35,998 --> 01:46:38,782
but if you don't want it,
I'll go.

1861
01:46:38,783 --> 01:46:40,480
You're out
of your fucking mind.

1862
01:46:40,481 --> 01:46:43,700
I'm not pulling my tooth out.

1863
01:46:43,701 --> 01:46:46,311
You know, Andrew, I've been
kind of locked up in a room

1864
01:46:46,312 --> 01:46:49,054
and the idea of consequences...

1865
01:46:50,708 --> 01:46:52,448
has been on my mind.

1866
01:46:52,449 --> 01:46:54,233
Millie, let me the fuck out!

1867
01:46:55,844 --> 01:46:56,888
Okay.

1868
01:46:58,150 --> 01:47:01,284
What if I sweeten the pot?

1869
01:47:02,851 --> 01:47:04,156
You know, the teapot.

1870
01:47:07,029 --> 01:47:08,638
What are you doing?

1871
01:47:10,554 --> 01:47:14,252
Mother Winchester's
heirloom dishes are

1872
01:47:14,253 --> 01:47:16,691
really, really fucking nice.

1873
01:47:18,910 --> 01:47:20,084
Millie, stop it!

1874
01:47:20,085 --> 01:47:21,869
Millie, stop.

1875
01:47:21,870 --> 01:47:24,872
These cups, they're like
little doll cups, Andrew!

1876
01:47:24,873 --> 01:47:26,221
Millie, stop it right now!

1877
01:47:26,222 --> 01:47:28,049
- Like a doll cup.
- Stop it, right now!

1878
01:47:28,050 --> 01:47:29,790
Millie! Stop it!

1879
01:47:29,791 --> 01:47:32,924
Cece would've loved
to drink juice out of these.

1880
01:47:34,883 --> 01:47:36,318
Millie, please, stop it.

1881
01:47:36,319 --> 01:47:38,538
- Stop it! Stop it, Millie!
- What... A gravy boat?

1882
01:47:38,539 --> 01:47:40,191
I fucking love gravy.

1883
01:47:40,192 --> 01:47:41,802
I had no idea they made these.

1884
01:47:41,803 --> 01:47:44,195
Please, Millie, Millie,
Millie, stop it right now!

1885
01:47:44,196 --> 01:47:45,458
Huh.

1886
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:47,721
Please, stop! Stop!
Millie, please!

1887
01:47:47,722 --> 01:47:49,593
Little plates, just breaking.

1888
01:47:51,029 --> 01:47:53,509
Stop it right
the fuck now, Millie!

1889
01:47:53,510 --> 01:47:55,468
Millie, what do you want?
I'll give you anything.

1890
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:57,644
You want fucking money?
I'll give you money!

1891
01:47:57,645 --> 01:48:00,124
I hope your plate guy's
really fucking good.

1892
01:48:00,125 --> 01:48:02,475
What the fuck do you want?

1893
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:05,303
Okay, so we're bargaining now.
That's a really good sign.

1894
01:48:05,304 --> 01:48:07,568
But what I want you
to do, Andrew,

1895
01:48:08,569 --> 01:48:11,485
is pull out
your fucking tooth.

1896
01:48:13,922 --> 01:48:15,401
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1897
01:48:18,361 --> 01:48:20,232
Not if I kill you first.

1898
01:48:21,582 --> 01:48:23,017
Fuck you.

1899
01:48:23,018 --> 01:48:26,978
So Nina didn't tell you
why I was in prison, huh?

1900
01:48:29,285 --> 01:48:31,243
I was imprisoned for murder.

1901
01:48:35,247 --> 01:48:38,902
What are you doing? Millie?

1902
01:48:38,903 --> 01:48:41,036
Millie, what are
you doing? Millie!

1903
01:48:41,602 --> 01:48:42,820
Millie.

1904
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:46,694
Millie?

1905
01:48:50,611 --> 01:48:52,525
Okay, okay, okay,
Millie, Millie, stop.

1906
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:55,179
Stop, stop, stop! Stop! Stop!

1907
01:48:55,180 --> 01:48:57,269
Okay, okay. Okay.
I'll do it. I'll do it.

1908
01:49:00,664 --> 01:49:01,970
Okay, wait, I wanna watch.

1909
01:49:10,195 --> 01:49:12,720
Okay.

1910
01:49:17,246 --> 01:49:19,421
Okay, put some elbow grease
into it.

1911
01:49:40,138 --> 01:49:41,270
I did it.

1912
01:49:42,488 --> 01:49:43,577
Millie, let me out.

1913
01:49:45,056 --> 01:49:46,580
Okay, slide it under the door.

1914
01:49:50,584 --> 01:49:51,628
Here.

1915
01:50:02,770 --> 01:50:04,553
Please let me out.

1916
01:50:04,554 --> 01:50:06,163
I'll come back in the morning.

1917
01:50:06,164 --> 01:50:07,470
What?

1918
01:50:08,297 --> 01:50:09,733
What? No, Millie, come back!

1919
01:50:10,995 --> 01:50:14,607
No, Millie. Millie let me out!

1920
01:50:14,608 --> 01:50:16,305
Let me out!

1921
01:50:20,222 --> 01:50:23,660
If he wants
to step into my shoes...

1922
01:50:43,027 --> 01:50:44,637
...with my doctor

1923
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:48,466
or have the cook flavor
my omelet with arsenic, eh?

1924
01:50:48,467 --> 01:50:50,033
What are the odds, gentlemen,

1925
01:50:50,034 --> 01:50:52,602
that I live to see
Mr. Barry hanged?

1926
01:51:03,395 --> 01:51:06,921
[ON TV] ...in James'
chronicle, dive at spa...

1927
01:51:25,069 --> 01:51:28,943
...should've seen the look
on the Frenchmen's faces
when 23 rampaged...

1928
01:51:44,915 --> 01:51:46,961
...and there
were cannonballs.

1929
01:52:04,718 --> 01:52:05,892
Millie.

1930
01:52:05,893 --> 01:52:08,546
Hey, it's Nina.

1931
01:52:08,547 --> 01:52:10,680
You okay? I'm gonna
get you out of here.

1932
01:52:25,695 --> 01:52:27,523
Nina, what the fuck
are you doing?

1933
01:52:28,567 --> 01:52:30,046
I missed you so much!

1934
01:52:35,792 --> 01:52:38,447
You knew she'd
do this to me, didn't you?

1935
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:40,623
Fuck!

1936
01:52:41,145 --> 01:52:42,190
Millie!

1937
01:52:46,803 --> 01:52:48,457
Come here, Millie.

1938
01:52:52,548 --> 01:52:54,505
What are you gonna do, Millie?

1939
01:53:02,514 --> 01:53:05,517
Millie! Motherfucker!

1940
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:07,257
Millie!

1941
01:53:09,217 --> 01:53:12,568
Millie! Come on, baby.
Come on, Millie.

1942
01:53:14,048 --> 01:53:16,267
What the fuck!

1943
01:53:18,139 --> 01:53:19,183
Millie!

1944
01:53:22,796 --> 01:53:24,580
Millie?

1945
01:53:26,408 --> 01:53:27,670
Come on, Millie.

1946
01:53:28,366 --> 01:53:29,845
Come on, baby.

1947
01:53:29,846 --> 01:53:30,847
Millie?

1948
01:53:33,371 --> 01:53:37,592
♪ Will your eyes return
to mine?♪

1949
01:53:37,593 --> 01:53:40,464
Will you come
the fuck out, Millie?

1950
01:53:40,465 --> 01:53:43,903
Come on, baby.
I need you, Millie. Millie!

1951
01:53:43,904 --> 01:53:45,948
Millie, get the fuck out here!

1952
01:53:45,949 --> 01:53:47,559
Leave her alone!

1953
01:53:49,344 --> 01:53:52,260
Millie! I miss you
so fucking much.

1954
01:54:05,795 --> 01:54:06,970
Millie's gone.

1955
01:54:11,845 --> 01:54:12,976
So I guess you...

1956
01:54:14,195 --> 01:54:16,066
I guess you just came back
for nothing.

1957
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:17,980
Guess I did.

1958
01:54:17,981 --> 01:54:19,677
Yeah. Sorry.

1959
01:54:19,678 --> 01:54:20,940
Mmm.

1960
01:54:23,857 --> 01:54:25,293
Look at us.

1961
01:54:26,163 --> 01:54:27,772
I fucked up

1962
01:54:27,773 --> 01:54:28,818
really bad.

1963
01:54:31,342 --> 01:54:33,300
Yeah.

1964
01:54:33,301 --> 01:54:35,737
I can admit when I'm wrong,
you know that.

1965
01:54:38,393 --> 01:54:40,961
We just sweep this
under the rug and we...

1966
01:54:46,096 --> 01:54:48,271
start fresh.

1967
01:54:48,272 --> 01:54:51,493
Pretend like
this didn't happen. Please?

1968
01:54:54,409 --> 01:54:55,453
I'm sorry.

1969
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:58,848
I still love you.

1970
01:55:00,763 --> 01:55:02,286
I mean,
you're still just the...

1971
01:55:03,635 --> 01:55:05,811
cute, helpless secretary I saw

1972
01:55:07,248 --> 01:55:08,902
sitting there in that office

1973
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:11,381
with your leaky boobs.

1974
01:55:11,382 --> 01:55:13,036
Oh.

1975
01:55:16,735 --> 01:55:18,998
You were so cute.

1976
01:55:18,999 --> 01:55:22,132
And I just tried to help you.
I just tried to help you bring

1977
01:55:23,481 --> 01:55:24,873
that baby into the world,

1978
01:55:24,874 --> 01:55:27,355
who had no hope
of a future at all.

1979
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:29,573
- Oh, God.
- See.

1980
01:55:29,574 --> 01:55:31,880
You can't... What...
What are you gonna...

1981
01:55:31,881 --> 01:55:34,796
What are you gonna do
out there?

1982
01:55:34,797 --> 01:55:37,625
You can't, Nina,
you can't find this.

1983
01:55:37,626 --> 01:55:38,670
I might.

1984
01:55:39,149 --> 01:55:40,368
At this age?

1985
01:55:41,499 --> 01:55:42,718
I don't think so, baby.

1986
01:55:45,895 --> 01:55:50,638
One call and Millie is
back in prison, rotting away.

1987
01:55:50,639 --> 01:55:53,207
One week on your own
and you will be begging me...

1988
01:55:55,296 --> 01:55:56,818
to take you back.

1989
01:55:56,819 --> 01:55:58,995
So just... just stay.

1990
01:56:00,562 --> 01:56:01,606
Please.

1991
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:05,045
Just stay.

1992
01:56:07,308 --> 01:56:08,700
Sweetheart...

1993
01:56:13,183 --> 01:56:15,011
everything you have is a lie.

1994
01:56:16,839 --> 01:56:19,972
Your daddy just handed you
your career.

1995
01:56:19,973 --> 01:56:21,886
Your child isn't
even really yours.

1996
01:56:21,887 --> 01:56:24,019
You have a wife
who fucking hates you.

1997
01:56:24,020 --> 01:56:25,412
And all these years

1998
01:56:25,413 --> 01:56:27,109
I've been watching you
dance around

1999
01:56:27,110 --> 01:56:28,545
like a fucking clown

2000
01:56:28,546 --> 01:56:30,852
just to get a little tiny
semblance of affection

2001
01:56:30,853 --> 01:56:32,245
from your cunt mother.

2002
01:56:32,246 --> 01:56:35,423
And you know what?
I almost feel sorry for you.

2003
01:56:39,383 --> 01:56:40,732
But I'd rather be dead...

2004
01:56:43,561 --> 01:56:46,608
than spend another day
with you, you fucking monster.

2005
01:56:57,053 --> 01:56:59,186
It would be my pleasure.

2006
01:57:00,665 --> 01:57:02,362
Pleasure's all mine.

2007
01:57:22,165 --> 01:57:23,601
What are you doing?

2008
01:57:37,746 --> 01:57:39,312
He fell...

2009
01:57:39,313 --> 01:57:41,054
trying to change a light bulb.

2010
01:57:42,185 --> 01:57:43,534
You know how he was.

2011
01:57:45,101 --> 01:57:46,581
Everything had to be perfect.

2012
01:57:59,028 --> 01:58:00,073
Run.

2013
01:58:01,248 --> 01:58:02,249
Don't come back.

2014
01:58:03,554 --> 01:58:05,078
You didn't kill him, I did.

2015
01:58:09,647 --> 01:58:13,781
No one's gonna believe that he
fell changing a lightbulb, Nina.

2016
01:58:13,782 --> 01:58:15,218
I guess we're gonna find out.

2017
01:58:17,177 --> 01:58:18,178
Go.

2018
01:58:22,878 --> 01:58:24,488
You didn't
deserve any of this.

2019
01:58:27,143 --> 01:58:28,231
Neither did you.

2020
01:58:49,818 --> 01:58:51,950
Actions have
consequences, Andrew.

2021
01:59:03,875 --> 01:59:06,050
Enzo, it's done.

2022
01:59:06,051 --> 01:59:08,576
I'm gonna need
your help cleaning up.

2023
01:59:11,622 --> 01:59:13,972
This must be
quite a shock.

2024
01:59:15,235 --> 01:59:17,366
You said you just
returned home this evening

2025
01:59:17,367 --> 01:59:19,716
after visiting your daughter
at camp.

2026
01:59:19,717 --> 01:59:21,675
And your housekeeper had
the week off.

2027
01:59:21,676 --> 01:59:24,634
That's right. Yeah.

2028
01:59:24,635 --> 01:59:26,375
Do you have any idea
why your husband might have

2029
01:59:26,376 --> 01:59:29,335
decided to change a light bulb
in the middle of the night?

2030
01:59:29,336 --> 01:59:30,424
I...

2031
01:59:31,076 --> 01:59:32,599
I guess,

2032
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:34,296
you know, well,
he liked things...

2033
01:59:34,297 --> 01:59:36,299
...to be a certain way,

2034
01:59:36,952 --> 01:59:38,432
everything perfect.

2035
01:59:42,610 --> 01:59:45,003
He had quite a deep cut
on his neck.

2036
01:59:48,311 --> 01:59:50,183
You don't normally see that
from a fall.

2037
01:59:55,449 --> 01:59:58,320
I actually knew your husband
a little bit.

2038
01:59:58,321 --> 02:00:00,932
He was engaged
to my sister, Kathleen.

2039
02:00:02,717 --> 02:00:03,805
Kathy.

2040
02:00:05,676 --> 02:00:09,244
Eight years ago,
she showed up on my doorstep
in the middle of the night

2041
02:00:09,245 --> 02:00:11,639
and she was never
the same after that.

2042
02:00:15,425 --> 02:00:16,818
I'm sorry to hear that.

2043
02:00:19,777 --> 02:00:21,692
It must have been
quite a violent fall.

2044
02:00:23,172 --> 02:00:24,217
Lots of impact.

2045
02:00:25,653 --> 02:00:26,828
Skin breaks.

2046
02:00:28,264 --> 02:00:29,265
Bones break.

2047
02:00:32,137 --> 02:00:33,182
Teeth break.

2048
02:00:44,324 --> 02:00:45,672
It seems to me this is

2049
02:00:45,673 --> 02:00:47,675
just one of those
freak household accidents.

2050
02:00:50,808 --> 02:00:53,246
Sometimes bad things happen
to good people.

2051
02:01:09,174 --> 02:01:12,481
We gather here today
to mourn the tragic passing

2052
02:01:12,482 --> 02:01:14,179
of Andrew Winchester.

2053
02:01:15,703 --> 02:01:17,094
Devoted son,

2054
02:01:17,095 --> 02:01:19,793
dedicated husband and father,

2055
02:01:19,794 --> 02:01:22,622
a respected business leader,

2056
02:01:22,623 --> 02:01:25,712
and true pillar
of the community.

2057
02:01:25,713 --> 02:01:27,931
His untimely death has
left us all

2058
02:01:27,932 --> 02:01:29,759
with a sense of shock,

2059
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:32,284
that such a vital
and caring man could

2060
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:34,590
suddenly be taken from us.

2061
02:01:34,591 --> 02:01:40,422
We struggle in these times
to understand God's plan,

2062
02:01:40,423 --> 02:01:43,818
and it is natural to question
God's power in times of grief.

2063
02:01:45,602 --> 02:01:48,909
But we must
never lose our faith

2064
02:01:48,910 --> 02:01:51,390
- in God's love.
- Hi. Thank you for coming.

2065
02:01:51,391 --> 02:01:52,653
Thank you.

2066
02:01:53,741 --> 02:01:56,438
- Hi.
- Nina.

2067
02:01:56,439 --> 02:01:59,049
I'm so sorry.

2068
02:01:59,050 --> 02:02:01,661
Now, are you sure you're still
gonna sell the house?

2069
02:02:01,662 --> 02:02:04,316
What are you gonna do
all the way out in California?

2070
02:02:04,317 --> 02:02:07,101
Oh, well, I think we'll manage.

2071
02:02:07,102 --> 02:02:09,712
I'm so sorry about your son.

2072
02:02:09,713 --> 02:02:11,193
What a terrible accident.

2073
02:02:11,933 --> 02:02:13,847
He had a beautiful smile,

2074
02:02:13,848 --> 02:02:15,544
- didn't he?
- The best.

2075
02:02:15,545 --> 02:02:18,069
You know, they told me
he was missing a tooth

2076
02:02:18,896 --> 02:02:20,071
when they found him.

2077
02:02:20,898 --> 02:02:22,725
- Oh, my God.
- My God.

2078
02:02:22,726 --> 02:02:24,249
Yeah. Did you know that?

2079
02:02:25,512 --> 02:02:26,773
Did you?

2080
02:02:26,774 --> 02:02:28,384
That a tooth was gone?

2081
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:33,910
If you don't take care
of your teeth,

2082
02:02:33,911 --> 02:02:36,044
you lose the privilege
of having them,

2083
02:02:37,001 --> 02:02:38,960
because teeth...

2084
02:02:40,353 --> 02:02:41,702
are a privilege.

2085
02:02:44,226 --> 02:02:47,011
- My condolences.
- Take good care.

2086
02:02:51,538 --> 02:02:53,321
This is how
you allow her to dress

2087
02:02:53,322 --> 02:02:54,889
for her father's funeral?

2088
02:02:57,239 --> 02:02:58,501
Hey.

2089
02:03:04,377 --> 02:03:05,421
Excuse me.

2090
02:03:25,441 --> 02:03:26,486
I told you to run.

2091
02:03:27,095 --> 02:03:28,139
I can't run.

2092
02:03:29,053 --> 02:03:30,490
I'm on parole. Remember?

2093
02:03:44,373 --> 02:03:46,201
Just make a life for yourself.

2094
02:04:11,835 --> 02:04:15,838
Wow. Well, tell me
about yourself, Millie.

2095
02:04:15,839 --> 02:04:19,276
Well, I definitely didn't plan
on being a housemaid.

2096
02:04:19,277 --> 02:04:21,322
It sort of just
fell into my lap,

2097
02:04:21,323 --> 02:04:24,586
and I realized
I really enjoy it.

2098
02:04:24,587 --> 02:04:26,545
For the right families,
of course.

2099
02:04:26,546 --> 02:04:29,244
Nina Winchester
recommended you very highly.

2100
02:04:30,158 --> 02:04:31,202
She...

2101
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:36,555
She suggested you, actually.

2102
02:04:36,556 --> 02:04:38,819
Mrs. Winchester was
a pleasure to work for.

2103
02:04:40,951 --> 02:04:41,996
I...
