00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,732
SUNDAY, JUNE 1, 2025
I HELPED MOM MAKE LUNCH TODAY

2
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,747
CHECK TODAY'S TO-DO LIST

3
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,085
HAN SEO-YOON

4
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,378
ALARM

5
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:49,400
YOU HAVE MEMORY DISORDER FROM AN ACCIDENT
CHECK YOUR COMPUTER ON THE DESK!

6
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,903
WHEN YOU WAKE UP,
YOUR MEMORY RESETS TO BEFORE THE ACCIDENT

7
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,739
CHECK YOUR NOTES AND JOURNAL
WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING

8
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,491
HAN SEO-YOON
HAESOL HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR, CLASS 5, NO. 29

9
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,451
ALWAYS KEEP THE NOTEBOOK IN YOUR BAG

10
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,411
CHECK TODAY'S TO-DOS ON THE CALENDAR!

11
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,289
CHECK YOUR JOURNAL ON THE COMPUTER!
ALWAYS WRITE DOWN THINGS TO REMEMBER!

12
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,387
On January 8, 2025,

13
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,932
you got in a car accident
that left you with a memory disorder.

14
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,518
When you fall asleep,

15
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,188
your memory resets the next morning
to the moment of the accident.

16
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,857
It's a condition

17
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,859
called anterograde amnesia.

18
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,864
The only people who know about it

19
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,909
are your parents, Ji-min,
and the teachers at school.

20
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,455
You've been keeping a journal
every day since the accident.

21
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,810
Did you sleep well?

22
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,021
-Have some breakfast.
-Okay.

23
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,066
-Did you do your homework?
-We had homework?

24
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,277
-Why didn't you tell us before?
-So, none of you did it?

25
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,653
Hey, the bus is here.

26
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,251
Hi, Han Seo-yoon.

27
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,962
Why draw attention?
You think she'll be friends with you?

28
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,048
We're classmates, so we are friends.

29
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,592
Do you hear yourself?

30
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,302
Don't be an idiot.

31
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,805
-You're so embarrassing.
-"So we are friends." What a joke.

32
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,601
She's really pretty, isn't she?

33
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,980
Hey, you have a girlfriend.

34
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,483
I told you I liked her first.

35
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,027
That's true.

36
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,570
Do something, then.

37
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,364
No, I can't.

38
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,075
Why not? Just go for it.

39
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,618
How can I?

40
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,356
You punks! Are you trying to get killed?

41
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,150
-What the hell?
-Jeez, man.

42
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,444
-Are you okay?
-Sir, watch your driving!

43
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,696
What the heck was that?

44
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,327
That really hurt.

45
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,162
I think it'll bruise.

46
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,754
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,340
I'm really sorry.

48
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,995
I told you that's not how you do it.

49
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,079
You idiot.

50
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,123
-You need to hold it like this.
-What about you?

51
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,709
All right. Let's just go.

52
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,696
Hey.

53
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,158
Why do you keep putting up with that?

54
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,619
Sorry.

55
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,097
You punks! Seriously.

56
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,057
-Jeez.
-He had on his head some…

57
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,726
-Hey. What's with him?
-What?

58
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,686
You made a mess on my desk.

59
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,731
Oh, you're Dong-sik's deskmate, right?

60
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,691
I might have. Sorry.

61
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,026
Do you find that stuff funny?

62
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,570
Yeah, it makes me feel alive.

63
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,281
Give it a rest.

64
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,451
Stop bullying Dong-sik.
Don't you feel bad for him?

65
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,787
What, are you his boyfriend?
Do you think they're dating?

66
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,497
-What? For real?
-Oh, shit.

67
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,208
-Han Seo-yoon's getting asked out again.
-It never ends, huh?

68
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,960
-She's so stuck-up.
-She shot him down quick.

69
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,628
-She is pretty though.
-Should I try next?

70
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,131
-I did it once, and she shot me down.
-You idiot.

71
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,384
-You're such a lunatic.
-Hey, you should ask Han Seo-yoon out.

72
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,011
You want me to do what?

73
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,680
Tell her you like her.

74
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,018
-You want me to ask her out?
-Yeah.

75
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:17,770
Why?

76
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,230
No reason.

77
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,065
Forget it.

78
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,984
Why did I bother coming over? I'm off.

79
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,778
Hey, Dung-sik. You ask her out, then!

80
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,822
-Hey, get back here!
-Since when were you there?

81
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,074
-Come here, dude!
-Dung-sik!

82
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,317
What am I doing?

83
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:15,286
HEY, TURN AROUND AND LOOK UP
AT THE CLASSROOM WINDOW

84
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,753
JAE-WON ♥ SEO-YOON

85
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,475
It's similar.

86
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,643
Here's a modern translation.

87
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,063
"Are you really leaving?"

88
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,814
"Are you leaving me behind?"

89
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,817
So, we went over "Gashiri" today.

90
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,237
I'M SORRY FOR ALL THE TROUBLE

91
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,364
Make sure to review the characteristics
I mentioned at the end,

92
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:55,576
and look over the materials
for the next class if you can.

93
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,913
All right, that's it for today.
Enjoy your lunch.

94
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,748
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

95
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,708
Let's hurry!

96
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,502
-There'll be a line!
-Let's go!

97
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:05,962
Kim Jae-won.

98
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,755
Hey, Dung-sik!

99
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,716
-You haven't left for lunch.
-What's up?

100
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,097
So, have you made up your mind?

101
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,390
Is that really all you want?

102
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,642
I'll just ask her and leave it at that.

103
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,102
Yeah, just do that.

104
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,186
Keep your word.

105
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,441
-Hey, he's actually going to do it!
-You're so cool, Jae-won!

106
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,446
Hey.

107
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,120
Will you go out with me?

108
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,751
I think he's really doing it. Hurry!

109
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,005
Hey, start filming. Hurry.

110
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,551
He's doing it.

111
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,012
Is he really doing it?

112
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,352
Okay.

113
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,313
Okay.

114
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,984
Wait, what?

115
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,320
I'd like that.

116
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,404
Let's go out.

117
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,240
-What did she say?
-I don't believe it.

118
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,867
-Let's meet after school.
-For real?

119
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,577
-I'll go first.
-What?

120
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,204
Why would she say yes?

121
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,623
-What? Why?
-What?

122
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,875
What the heck?

123
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,711
Why?

124
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,924
-Hey. Stay still.
-What are you doing?

125
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,888
For example, y is equal

126
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,640
-to x squared plus three.
-Jae-won.

127
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:45,478
It's shifted up by three units,
and y equals x minus two squared.

128
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,313
-How does it shift?
-How manly.

129
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,567
-He's so cool.
-It shifts two units to the right.

130
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,953
Hurry up. I'm starving.

131
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,712
Hi.

132
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,300
Hi.

133
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,189
You're Kim Jae-won, right?

134
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,482
Yeah, that's right.

135
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,109
Give me your phone.

136
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,155
Why?

137
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,167
Here.

138
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,630
"Junior, Class 2, Kim Jae-won."

139
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,092
"My boyfriend is a man of few words."

140
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,635
Did you call me your boyfriend?

141
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,220
Yeah.

142
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,807
What? You asked me out first.

143
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,642
Isn't that right,

144
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,018
boyfriend?

145
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,813
Oh, right. I did.

146
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,901
You see, the thing is…

147
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,948
Some kids are bullying my deskmate,

148
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,118
so I couldn't just sit back and watch.

149
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,995
They promised they'd stop bullying him

150
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,164
if I asked you out.

151
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,332
That's why I did it.

152
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,376
I'm sorry.

153
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,838
You're a good friend.

154
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,258
We're just deskmates, really.

155
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,386
Well, I don't care what the reason is.

156
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,721
Does it matter to you?

157
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,390
Do you not want to go out with me?

158
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,476
-No, I--
-All right, then.

159
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,147
It's not that I don't want to, but…

160
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,274
Do you…

161
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,569
like me?

162
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,570
No.

163
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,696
Then, why?

164
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,033
I want to try something new.

165
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,536
Otherwise, life gets boring.

166
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,829
You're on board, right?

167
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,416
But I have a few dating conditions.

168
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,293
Number one,

169
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,086
we keep communication short.

170
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,755
Number two,

171
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,840
we don't talk to each other
until after school.

172
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,467
Number three,

173
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,093
we don't catch real feelings.

174
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,971
-What do you--
-Let's go.

175
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:26,931
Go where?

176
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,019
Am I supposed to come?

177
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,604
Yeah!

178
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,607
What's your favorite season?

179
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,691
My favorite season?

180
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,151
Summer.

181
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,653
Favorite number?

182
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,990
-Five.
-"Five."

183
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:46,408
Favorite subject?

184
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,495
I guess Korean history.

185
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,956
-Korean history?
-Yeah.

186
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,459
What's your favorite food?

187
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,545
I like anything with meat.

188
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,921
What are you doing, by the way?

189
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,090
We're a couple starting today,

190
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,384
so I should know you a little better.

191
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,387
There we go.

192
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:14,770
Hey.

193
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,440
Black bean noodles
or spicy seafood noodle soup?

194
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,192
Black bean noodles.

195
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,235
"Black bean noodles."

196
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,947
Do you like hard or soft peaches?

197
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,909
I'm allergic to peaches.

198
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,412
That's a shame.

199
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,831
"Allergic."

200
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,417
What's your MBTI?

201
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,669
I've never taken the test.

202
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,755
-Are you serious?
-I'm going to do it.

203
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,675
-Do it soon.
-Okay.

204
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,094
What's your favorite game?

205
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,389
I'm not really into games.

206
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,724
"Not into games."

207
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:52,850
Favorite K-pop idol?

208
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,393
I'm not really

209
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,604
into them either.

210
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,105
So, no favorites?

211
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,191
I see.

212
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,155
"MBTI,

213
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,657
favorite game, and fanboy interests

214
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,242
are unclear."

215
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,670
Hello.

216
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,255
Hello.

217
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,346
Come on.

218
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,542
Oh, I do have a favorite song.

219
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,503
What is it?

220
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,505
Hold on.

221
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,635
Hang on.

222
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,304
I like this one.

223
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,014
"GOOD NIGHT GOOD DREAM"
NERD CONNECTION

224
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,140
I should check it out.

225
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,226
You really don't have to do that.

226
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,145
What's your favorite sport?

227
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,480
I don't like sports.

228
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,357
What?

229
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,316
Why not?

230
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,152
You look like you'd be great at sports.

231
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,446
It makes you sweaty.

232
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,198
What?

233
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,951
Why are you laughing?

234
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,873
Are you a germaphobe or something?

235
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,752
Come on. I'm not a germaphobe.

236
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,214
I just care about cleanliness.

237
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,300
-You care about…
-I care about cleanliness.

238
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,052
"Cares about cleanliness."

239
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,846
By the way,
why are you writing down all this?

240
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,141
You don't seem like the ordinary type.

241
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:58,976
No?

242
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,687
I could say the same about you.

243
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,568
I guess I'm not exactly ordinary.

244
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,103
Why are you still up?

245
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,147
Keep that up, and you won't grow taller.

246
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,816
Like I need to.
I'm taller than you now, Dad.

247
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,069
-What?
-Have dinner. I made soybean paste stew.

248
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,905
Oh dear. I already ate.

249
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,532
Just leave it.
I'll have it for breakfast tomorrow.

250
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,577
Go to bed already.

251
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,140
HAN SEO-YOON
GOOD NIGHT

252
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,145
Number one,

253
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,897
we keep communication short.

254
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,566
She's so quirky.

255
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,320
Wait up!

256
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,494
-Hey!
-Hey.

257
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,546
It's Kim Jae-won.

258
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,089
-Hey!
-It's Kim Jae-won.

259
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,643
Hi.

260
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,628
Number two,

261
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,755
we don't talk to each other
until after school.

262
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,154
What?

263
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,822
Stop.

264
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,990
Stop what?

265
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,951
I want you to stop dating Seo-yoon.

266
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,370
Why?

267
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,997
You don't even like her.

268
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,417
How would you know that?

269
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,338
You've never even
said hello to her before.

270
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,471
I'm curious

271
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,765
about what kind of person she is.

272
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,310
Let me see your phone.

273
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,650
Wait. Is she getting his number?

274
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,194
Oh, we've got a love triangle.

275
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,320
He's so cool.

276
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,198
-He is.
-Give it back.

277
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,658
-I don't think so.
-It's mine. Give it back.

278
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,243
-Hey, Jin!
-Give it back.

279
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,619
Oh jeez.

280
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,204
Sorry.

281
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,288
What is this?

282
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,040
You crazy punk.

283
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,250
-Hey, pass.
-Hey!

284
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,043
-What is it?
-Stop it.

285
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,419
Hey, pass it.

286
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,671
It's mine. Give it back.

287
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,423
-Pass it again.
-Hey, Gi-hyeon!

288
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,092
You're such an otaku.

289
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,928
-Give it back. It's mine.
-Why should I?

290
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:10,769
Knock it off.

291
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,479
He doesn't like it.

292
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,566
You don't like it?

293
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,612
We made a deal.

294
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,869
-Hi, Kim Jae-won.
-Oh jeez.

295
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,957
-What?
-You smell nice.

296
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,667
You smell really nice.

297
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,460
I do?

298
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,378
Yeah.

299
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,090
I think it's just the fabric softener.

300
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,216
You're free, right?

301
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,551
Right now?

302
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,303
-Let's go.
-Go where?

303
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,103
Oh, I got it!

304
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,898
Get out of the way. I can't see!

305
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,442
I can't lose.

306
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,652
-You picked an easy one on purpose.
-No, I didn't.

307
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,491
Can you handle this?

308
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,452
No.

309
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,162
BULDAK FIRE NOODLES

310
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,705
I can't handle it!

311
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,590
-Is it too spicy?
-No.

312
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,634
I need something to drink.

313
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,386
You can't finish it?

314
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,476
I have a headache.

315
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,481
…HE WENT TO GET A DRINK,
AND THAT WAS KIND OF CUTE

316
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,652
Kim Jae-won!

317
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,533
Jeez.

318
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,659
Let's go.

319
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,120
Let's go.

320
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,080
Okay.

321
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,341
No way.

322
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,636
Let's bend down.

323
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,483
Jeez, you scared me!

324
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,123
Kim Jae-won!

325
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,545
"GOOD NIGHT GOOD DREAM"

326
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,424
What was it about me

327
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,511
That you loved

328
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,599
So deeply about me?

329
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:04,359
All I can offer you now is

330
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:09,948
Good night, good dream, goodbye

331
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:18,498
Good night, good dream, goodbye

332
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:26,131
I WANTED JAE-WON TO SING A FEW MORE SONGS,
BUT HE WAS TOO SHY

333
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,553
-Hey, get him!
-Get him!

334
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,221
-Hey!
-Get him!

335
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,056
Hey, put that down!

336
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,313
-Hey, get that punk!
-Come here, you bastard!

337
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,481
-Hey!
-Get him!

338
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,482
Hey!

339
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,151
Let go!

340
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,737
Let go, asshole!

341
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,030
Let go!

342
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,411
-You bastard.
-Come at me, asshole.

343
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,621
-Get him.
-You crazy bastard.

344
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,872
-You asshole.
-Come here.

345
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,417
What the hell was that?

346
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,253
-Forget him. Get him off him.
-Damn it.

347
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,006
-You asshole!
-You bastard!

348
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,050
-Damn it.
-Let go!

349
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,134
Let go, you bastard!

350
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,889
That goddamn psycho!

351
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,897
-You son of a bitch!
-Come here!

352
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,316
-You asshole!
-You bastard!

353
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,609
Stomp him!

354
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,237
Stomp him!

355
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,448
You piece of shit.

356
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,785
-What's this?
-Who the hell was that?

357
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,079
Is that asshole out of his mind?

358
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,750
-Get over here.
-Come here.

359
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,502
You son of a bitch.

360
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,129
You're getting me too!

361
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,132
Stop that, you piece of shit!

362
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,592
I said stop it!

363
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,052
Stop it!

364
00:25:56,471 --> 00:26:00,725
-I'm going to kill you too!
-Teacher! Help!

365
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:02,811
What was that?

366
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,064
-We're being filmed!
-Dude, run!

367
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,108
Damn it!

368
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:14,990
I got it on camera.

369
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,551
-It hurts, asshat.
-Ass…

370
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,846
Do it yourself.

371
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,222
No, do it for me.

372
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,141
-Forget it. You do it.
-I'm sorry. Help me out.

373
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,604
-Turn your head.
-Like this?

374
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,114
You really got hit all over.

375
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,657
You should see the other guys.

376
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,453
-Now, turn the other way.
-What?

377
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,787
Do this side a bit more.

378
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,456
Come on.

379
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,623
What?

380
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,750
Turn your head already.

381
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:09,794
What are you looking…

382
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,095
Why did you guys fight anyway?

383
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,307
They're not nice guys.

384
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,933
It was just a spat.

385
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,060
I see.

386
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,979
Why didn't you help me from the start?

387
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,814
Why wait until the last minute?

388
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,609
I thought you were good at fighting.

389
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,320
I'm not a good fighter.

390
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,696
Then, you should've run away.

391
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,201
I don't think I'd be good at that either.

392
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,703
Oh, I know.

393
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,663
It's because
you don't like to sweat, right?

394
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,584
Isn't sweating better than bleeding?

395
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,586
You're right. It is better.

396
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,381
Tell me if they bother you again.
I've got the recording.

397
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,390
-What?
-What are you looking at?

398
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:44,431
UNDERSEA GLASS STUDIO

399
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,417
Do you miss her a lot?

400
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,502
Today? Yeah.

401
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,421
I guess.

402
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,968
You miss your mom a lot too, don't you?

403
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,598
Yeah.

404
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,309
I think…

405
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,645
I miss her even more than I did back then.

406
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,526
Back then, it was all just sad and hard,

407
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,489
and I didn't know what to do.

408
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,407
But now that it's been a while…

409
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,077
I don't know about anything else…

410
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,874
other than the fact that I miss her.

411
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,386
That's why

412
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,223
I hope…

413
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,268
you won't have such a hard time anymore.

414
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,395
Honestly,

415
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:18,233
I want you to start taking photos again,

416
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:20,944
meet your friends,

417
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,905
and go out and have fun once in a while.

418
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,783
I want that for you.

419
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,118
Thinking about your mom

420
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,080
and missing her…

421
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,125
isn't hard.

422
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,423
I think it's nice
that I get to think about her.

423
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,094
It is nice, but…

424
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,013
What I'm saying is,

425
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,267
I want you to spend more time having fun

426
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,270
than thinking about Mom.

427
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,108
All right, I hear you.

428
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,737
You're nagging more and more now.

429
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,545
I'll eat it if you won't.

430
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,592
Why do you keep following me around?

431
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,553
I'm letting you hang out with me.
You have no friends.

432
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,979
By the way,
are you really dating Seo-yoon?

433
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,984
Why do you act like total strangers?

434
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,362
We just decided to do that at school.

435
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,114
Why do you even care?

436
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,240
What's that about?

437
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,452
I don't know either.

438
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,203
What's up with that?

439
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,831
What's with them?

440
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,293
No way.

441
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,547
-Is this your first…
-What?

442
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,929
Here we go again.
Why do you always bring up dumb stuff?

443
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:12,889
Dude.

444
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,683
-It's your first time dating a girl, huh?
-Can we not talk about this?

445
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,727
-What's wrong with you?
-Listen, kiddo.

446
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,021
Here's the thing about dating.

447
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,608
If you don't do what the girl says,
you're in trouble.

448
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,110
But if you only do what she says,

449
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,528
you'll be in bigger trouble.

450
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,573
What does that even mean?

451
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,825
What are you doing?

452
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,578
Jeez, that hurts.

453
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,704
Love hurts.

454
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,790
See?

455
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,083
It's all about timing.

456
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,296
How will you kiss
or make out with her at this rate?

457
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,839
What's the matter with you?

458
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,424
Give it a rest!

459
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,051
Hey, cut it out!

460
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,513
-What are they doing?
-Fine, I'll stop.

461
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,224
-Oh my gosh.
-Kiss!

462
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,283
THE FINALS ARE IN TWO WEEKS, YOU KNOW…

463
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,967
I'M JUST CLEARING MY HEAD FOR A MINUTE!!

464
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,593
WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR TEN MINUTES

465
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,856
YOU'RE A T, AREN'T YOU?

466
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,816
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH…

467
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,698
You should really study.

468
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,658
I'm just about to start.

469
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,910
Your scribbling says otherwise.

470
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:58,911
Get started already.

471
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,496
I said I'm going to.

472
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,475
Do you want to go on a date this weekend?

473
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,484
The maximum value is

474
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,028
x equals x squared…

475
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,573
OKAY

476
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,641
Kim Jae-won.

477
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,726
Hey.

478
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,189
-Hi.
-Hi.

479
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,695
I've only ever seen you in your uniform,

480
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,822
so seeing you like this

481
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,740
feels so awkward.

482
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,078
I found a really nice spot earlier.

483
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,329
Do you want to check it out?

484
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,666
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

485
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,296
-Did you have breakfast?
-Yeah.

486
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,841
-What about you?
-Me too.

487
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,026
Ta-da!

488
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,571
Oh my, what's this?

489
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,239
Did you make it yourself?

490
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,323
Yeah.

491
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,617
You're amazing.

492
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,036
It's not that big of a deal.

493
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,038
I'm just used to doing
the housework myself,

494
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,499
so I got good at doing stuff like this.

495
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,209
Oh, did your mom teach you?

496
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,089
It's just me and my dad.

497
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,591
My mom

498
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,759
passed away five years ago.

499
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,469
I see.

500
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,391
I'm sorry.

501
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,770
For some reason,
I feel like I can tell you anything.

502
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,773
Can I try this?

503
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,901
Of course, I made it for you. Hang on.

504
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,653
This one looks good.

505
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,120
How is it?

506
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,874
-Is it good?
-Yeah! It's so good!

507
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,085
-I'm glad.
-It's delicious!

508
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,131
It's so beautiful.

509
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,775
This is nice.

510
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,608
It's interesting.

511
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,653
What is?

512
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,239
It's just…

513
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,868
We haven't known each other long,

514
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,288
but it feels like

515
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,376
we've slowly been building up
all this time together.

516
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,374
Who are you?

517
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,375
What?

518
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,044
No, I mean…

519
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,465
What's wrong?

520
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,177
What's going on?

521
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,139
Wait! Where are you going?

522
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,849
Wait!

523
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:13,809
Hold on.

524
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,228
Where are you going?

525
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,526
What's wrong?

526
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,321
Where am I?

527
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,700
Here?

528
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,121
We had our date today, remember?

529
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,085
It's me, Jae-won.

530
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,711
Kim Jae-won.

531
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,423
I don't know.

532
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,803
I don't remember anything.

533
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,681
What do you mean you don't remember?

534
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,475
Seo-yoon.

535
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:43,941
BESTIE

536
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,035
Are you heading home already?

537
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,830
I guess the date
wasn't as good as you thought, huh?

538
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,083
Ji-min.

539
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,878
What's wrong? Did something happen?

540
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,006
I opened my eyes,

541
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,216
and I was on a bus.

542
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,469
But…

543
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,989
CHOI JI-MIN

544
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,664

00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,175
SATURDAY, MAY 24, 2025: GOT TO SCHOOL LATE
SUNDAY, MAY 25, 2025: STAYED HOME ALL DAY

548
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,801
MONDAY, MAY 26, 2025: HAD A BAD HEADACHE
TUESDAY, MAY 27, 2025: HOSPITAL CHECKUP

549
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,137
FRIDAY, MAY 30, 2025: NOTHING UNUSUAL
SATURDAY, MAY 31, 2025: WILL I GET BETTER?

550
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,682
MONDAY, JUNE 2, 2025
A TALL BOY WHO LOOKED HIGH-STRUNG…

551
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,060
Monday, June 2, 2025.

552
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,772
A tall boy who looked high-strung

553
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,107
walked up to me out of nowhere.

554
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,028
-"Will you go out with me?"
-Will you go out with me?

555
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,447
Junior, Class 2, Kim Jae-won.

556
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,116
I agreed to go out with him.

557
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,704
Maybe I'll get to try something new.

558
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,959
I gave him three conditions.

559
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,127
Rule number one of dating

560
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,213
is to keep communication short.

561
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:32,383
It'd be a problem if he brought up things
from the day before.

562
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:34,718
Rule number two

563
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,471
is that we don't talk to each other
until after school.

564
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,268
I need time to sort out
all the information about me and him.

565
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,105
And lastly, rule number three…

566
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,318
is that we don't catch real feelings.

567
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,613
We'll have to break up soon anyway.

568
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,580
So, there's no point
in having deep feelings.

569
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,184
Hey, so…

570
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:09,938
I'm--

571
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,148
Kim Jae-won.

572
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,317
Right?

573
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,030
Yeah, that's right.

574
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,371
Aren't you cold?

575
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:29,792
No.

576
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,256
You see…

577
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,512
I seem to have memory issues.

578
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,639
No, I mean…

579
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,478
I have a memory disorder.

580
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:51,772
It's…

581
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,568
It's called anterograde amnesia.

582
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,030
When I fall asleep,

583
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,573
I forget everything…

584
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,618
that happened that day.

585
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,081
So…

586
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,667
I…

587
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:13,877
If it's too hard…

588
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,881
you don't have to tell me now.

589
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,057
I'm sorry.

590
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,227
I used you for selfish reasons.

591
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,355
I thought…

592
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,860
maybe I could try something new
even though I'm like this.

593
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,074
You can use me.

594
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:47,661
What?

595
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,038
So…

596
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,834
if you don't write down
what happened today,

597
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,004
you won't know about it tomorrow, right?

598
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,548
Then,

599
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,219
don't write that you told me
you have a memory disorder.

600
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,805
What do you mean?

601
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,860
I have fun hanging out with you.

602
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,279
And…

603
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:28,035
I don't want things to change between us.

604
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,121
So,

605
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,249
let's both…

606
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,253
trick tomorrow-you together.

607
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:48,514
Of course, only if you're okay with it.

608
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,351
Well…

609
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,946
ANTEROGRADE AMNESIA

610
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:12,037
ANTEROGRADE AMNESIA IS WHEN YOU CAN'T FORM
NEW MEMORIES DUE TO HIPPOCAMPUS DAMAGE

611
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,718
Hi, Kim Jae-won.

612
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,519
Did something good happen?

613
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:36,478
Yeah.

614
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,437
What is it?

615
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,525
It's a secret. Let's go.

616
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,568
What?

617
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,445
What was that?

618
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,073
Your face is so transparent.

619
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:49,866
No, it's not.

620
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,535
See? I can read you right now.

621
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:52,452
Unbelievable.

622
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,079
-See?
-Me?

623
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,498
So, what did you want to tell me?

624
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,628
I wanted to thank you
for calling me yesterday.

625
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,672
You don't have to thank me.

626
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:07,676
I only do what I want to do
and what I can do.

627
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,305
Right.

628
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,807
It's really dangerous
if people spread rumors

629
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,809
that she has a memory disorder…

630
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:21,064
because whatever happens,
Seo-yoon won't remember anything.

631
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,524
You're right.

632
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,236
Not everyone in this world is good.

633
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,531
Speaking of which…

634
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:33,952
are you a good person?

635
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,960
I just…

636
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,797
want to make sure
every new day is a good day for her.

637
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,841
I want her journal

638
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,636
to be filled with happy memories.

639
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:56,725
Oh, and I asked her not to write
about what happened yesterday.

640
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,146
-What?
-I didn't want her to feel bad

641
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,982
or avoid me because of it.

642
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,987
I figured I should tell you.

643
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,907
Why?

644
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,118
Because…

645
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:17,954
I'm scared too.

646
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:19,873
What are you saying?

647
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,251
Anyway,

648
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,672
I think I can trust you now.

649
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:28,548
Really?

650
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,468
Just don't be irresponsible
and bail on her later.

651
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:32,928
If that ever happens,

652
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,472
I'll leave the rest to you.

653
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,140
That's exactly what irresponsible is.

654
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,604
Oh, right. I have a girlfriend.

655
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,694
You have a what?

656
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,028
A girlfriend.

657
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,156
A girl…

658
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,908
Look at you, all grown up.

659
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:56,910
Jeez, what are you doing?

660
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:58,203
I'm holding a knife here.

661
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,247
I'm jealous.

662
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,042
What are you talking about?

663
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,335
You know what?

664
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,461
That's it.

665
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,840
I need to give you some allowance.

666
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:13,093
Forget it. You don't have any money.

667
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,428
I have plenty, okay?

668
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,304
Things are going great
at the studio these days.

669
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,681
Look at this.

670
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:19,766
Here.

671
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:23,812
Show me a picture.

672
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:31,903
Is she pretty?

673
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:45,250
I think I asked to see Seo-yoon alone.
How did this happen?

674
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,127
Anyone?

675
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,131
Well?

676
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,925
Well, finally!

677
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,011
We're done with exams,
so what should we do?

678
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,680
What can we do?

679
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:02,184
What can we do that's so fun
it will make others jealous?

680
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:03,310
Do you have to be involved?

681
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,437
Come on, why would you say that?

682
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,524
Is there anything you wanted to do
or any place you wanted to go?

683
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:13,111
Something I wanted to do…

684
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,572
-Hold on.
-Okay.

685
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:17,616
Yeah.

686
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:22,037
We haven't hung out as a group in a while,
and exams are over…

687
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,831
It's nice, isn't it?

688
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,083
Hey, what are you…

689
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,086
Don't touch her. Why would you touch her?

690
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,047
-No, not me.
-What's wrong with you?

691
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,173
It's so cute.

692
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,842
-I know.
-Yeah?

693
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,219
There's a place I want to go.

694
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,178
Where?

695
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,806
I want to go see penguins.

696
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,308
What?

697
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,310
Penguins?

698
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,528
You're good.

699
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,829
-Hey, it's dangerous! Look ahead!
-Jeez, you scared me.

700
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,206
Are you worried about me?

701
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,461
Stop bickering, you two.

702
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,672
Hey, Choi Ji-min. Wait up!

703
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,465
Slow down!

704
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,105
How cute!

705
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,816
-They're super cute.
-They're really cute.

706
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:34,693
They're so cute!

707
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:35,735
Ji-min!

708
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,302
What the heck?

709
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,013
Yours too.

710
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,598
Look at your teeth.

711
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,224
Why did you want to see penguins?

712
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,144
Because it's so cute how they toddle.

713
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,521
Don't penguins waddle?

714
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,106
"Toddle" sounds cuter.

715
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,401
I hope we get to see them.

716
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,320
-Penguins…
-Oh, this must be it.

717
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,322
-Oh, here it is.
-Penguins?

718
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:22,949
What?

719
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,285
Where are the penguins?

720
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:27,913
THE PENGUINS ARE RESTING TODAY
SEE YOU NEXT TIME

721
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:28,955
No penguins?

722
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:32,167
Oh, they're resting.
Did they work too hard yesterday?

723
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:33,835
It's okay.

724
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,379
Maybe they'll come out if we wait.

725
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,756
Should we check out that side?

726
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,507
-Okay.
-Okay.

727
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,426
It's okay.

728
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,518
This place is amazing.

729
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,979
It's so beautiful.

730
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,148
I thought you might like it.

731
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,406
I had so much fun today.

732
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,494
It's so beautiful.

733
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:20,090
Kim Jae-won! Come on!

734
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,300
It feels so cool.

735
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,260
Be careful.

736
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,729
No, don't do it.

737
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,856
Seriously, don't do it.
I'll splash you back.

738
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:20,358
How do you tie your shoelaces like that?

739
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:39,669
You need to do it this way,

740
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:41,713
or they'll come undone.

741
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,257
It looks tricky.

742
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,808
It's okay.

743
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,643
I'll tie them for you.

744
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,567
This place is really beautiful.

745
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,486
It is.

746
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,405
Let's

747
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,532
come back here sometime.

748
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,785
Okay, let's come back.

749
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,333
And there goes

750
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,668
another day.

751
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,596
I'll make…

752
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,433
tomorrow-you happy too.

753
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,235
That was so cheesy!

754
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,154
You don't like it?

755
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:51,866
It's not that I don't like it,
but it was just so cheesy.

756
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,494
That was so cheesy!

757
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:55,954
I want to go home now.

758
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:07,465
…HE TIED MY SHOELACES

759
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,317
What's going on? Where are we going?

760
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,570
I don't know either.

761
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:29,487
You don't?

762
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,087
Ta-da!

763
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,840
-Hello.
-What? Kim Jae-won!

764
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:52,844
Here are the most handsome
and cutest penguins in the world!

765
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,762
-You're crazy.
-No way.

766
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,182
I told you girls love surprises, didn't I?

767
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,183
See? I was right.

768
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,809
-She's just laughing at me.
-No, she's not!

769
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:03,229
-I told you I didn't want to do it!
-Oh, shut it. She looks happy.

770
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,939
Hey, come on.

771
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,065
I'm leaving.

772
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,066
No, wait!

773
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,236
Wait, Mr. Penguin!
Let me take a picture first.

774
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,071
You're so cute!

775
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:15,492
-Take a picture of me too, Ji-min.
-Don't be shy. You look adorable.

776
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:18,495
Is this why you've been bothering me
the past few days?

777
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,913
What do you think? Not bad, right?

778
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,874
-Come on. Stop it.
-Come here. Please, just once.

779
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:25,710
-Strike a cute pose.
-No.

780
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:26,711
Give me a cute pose.

781
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:29,214
-She seems happy.
-No, forget it.

782
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,590
-Come on.
-Take a picture of me.

783
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,885
-Here we go!
-Let's pose.

784
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,721
One, two, three!

785
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,481
So cute.

786
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,042
…I WAS SO TOUCHED BY JAE-WON

787
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,842
IF ONLY I COULD REMEMBER THIS DAY…

788
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:25,520
I'll make tomorrow-you happy too.

789
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:35,238
UNDERSEA GLASS STUDIO

790
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,131
Focus, will you?

791
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,341
Yes, ma'am. I'll focus now.

792
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,094
I listen to you pretty well, don't I?

793
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:01,306
Don't I?

794
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,227
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

795
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,522
You're Seo-yoon, right?

796
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,107
-Yes. Hello.
-I thought so.

797
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,650
Here you go.

798
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:13,776
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

799
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,112
You're making good progress.

800
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,364
Do you need my help?

801
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,241
We're good, Dad. Thanks for the drinks.
You should go rest.

802
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,785
Okay.

803
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,390
-What?
-By any chance,

804
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:48,978
is your dad Kim Sang-hyeon,
the photographer?

805
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,606
My dad?

806
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:53,316
Yeah.

807
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:54,317
Yeah, that's him.

808
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:58,696
Are you serious? I'm a huge fan.

809
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,490
Look.

810
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,077
-She likes his work.
-I even follow him on Instagram.

811
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:08,831
He's one of her favorite photographers.

812
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,833
Who knew he was your dad?

813
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:12,126
That's so cool.

814
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,212
I want to see. Let me see.

815
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,134
-Mr. Kim!
-Why are you calling him?

816
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,636
-Are you busy?
-What are you going to do?

817
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,806
-Yeah?
-You've got a fan here, sir.

818
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,724
Hey, what are you doing?

819
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,393
You're into photography, huh?

820
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:29,936
Yes.

821
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:41,280
Okay.

822
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,783
She says she's not just a fan
but a huge fan.

823
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,576
All right. Thanks.

824
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:48,871
Oh, there's more? Okay.

825
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,921
You're her role model,

826
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:59,382
but she's too nervous to say anything.

827
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:00,550
You're flattering me.

828
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,721
Go on.

829
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:11,310
She's wondering
why you haven't posted any photos lately.

830
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:14,480
I've been busy.

831
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,662
-I'm home.
-Hey.

832
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,585
Stop drinking beer. You'll put on weight.

833
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,462
Did your friends go home?

834
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,047
Yeah, they did.

835
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:43,926
She's pretty.

836
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:48,598
Yeah.

837
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,433
She is.

838
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,310
My goodness.

839
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,940
I guess you've been coming home late
because you're busy dating.

840
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:01,819
Yeah.

841
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,238
Still, don't stay out too late.

842
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,824
It's not good for you to get tired.

843
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:08,826
You know, earlier,

844
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:13,706
Ji-min said she was a huge fan of yours.

845
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:17,001
You saw how she was, right?

846
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:30,348
Should we put Mom's things away now?

847
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:35,770
Yeah.

848
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,022
I guess.

849
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,524
Maybe later.

850
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,905
Let me fry you an egg or something.

851
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,323
It's fine. I'll do it.

852
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:48,658
-I can do it myself.
-I've got it.

853
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:51,452
You always get oil everywhere,
and cleaning that up is more work.

854
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,788
You little brat,
you think you're better than me.

855
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:54,705
How many do you want?

856
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:48,759
Hit it properly.

857
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,678
Go inside. I'll stand here.

858
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,432
Seo-yoon's parents called me this morning.

859
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,311
They said Seo-yoon…

860
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:02,732
seems to be afraid
of falling asleep these days.

861
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:03,983
What? Why?

862
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:06,569
I've been

863
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,822
trying really hard
to make her happy every day.

864
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:11,991
That's why.

865
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,744
The happier and more precious each day is,

866
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,748
the more it must hurt to forget them.

867
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,806
JAE-WON DESPERATELY TRIED
NOT TO MAKE EYE CONTACT IN THE CAFETERIA

868
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,643
Just like the Goryeo Dynasty,

869
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:41,395
there's one event that splits
the Joseon Dynasty in half.

870
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:44,106
In 1592, after the founding
of the Joseon Dynasty,

871
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,316
Japan invaded Joseon…

872
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:54,200
CHAPTER 6.
HOW THE BRAIN ENCODES MEMORIES

873
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:15,096
Thank you!

874
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:16,097
I got the banana milk.

875
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:18,975
You like this, right?

876
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,329
UNDERSTANDING PROCEDURAL MEMORY
IN THE MEMORY-PROCESSING SYSTEM

877
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,379
SUCH AS RIDING A BIKE,
PLAYING AN INSTRUMENT, OR TYPING

878
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,687
It's summer break soon.

879
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,190
I know.

880
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:10,401
Time flies.

881
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:17,324
Oh, I have a gift for you.

882
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:19,493
I made it myself. Ta-da.

883
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:21,579
Wait. No way.

884
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:23,080
What?

885
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,833
I brought mine to give to you.

886
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:28,210
What? No way.

887
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:32,006
Look.

888
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:35,259
It's really pretty
when you hold it up to the sunlight.

889
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:38,596
It's pretty.

890
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:39,972
Here.

891
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,391
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

892
01:07:42,933 --> 01:07:46,020
You did great for your first try.
It came out better than mine.

893
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:49,732
I was a budding artist
until middle school.

894
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:52,568
Of course, I've forgotten
pretty much everything now.

895
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:00,951
No.

896
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:03,370
I'm sure you haven't forgotten.

897
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,167
It's the kind of thing

898
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:12,088
your body remembers, not your mind.

899
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,216
I saw it on YouTube.

900
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:17,176
It's called procedural memory.

901
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,345
It's not rooted in your brain.

902
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:22,765
It's muscle memory rooted in your senses.

903
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:26,519
Is procedural memory

904
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:28,437
something that never goes away?

905
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,023
Even if you have amnesia,

906
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,275
you don't forget how to ride a bike.

907
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:49,458
You have a bug on you.

908
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:51,460
-Where?
-It's gone.

909
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:52,878
-Really?
-Yeah.

910
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:02,096
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT FIREWORKS FESTIVAL

911
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:05,766
This means you want to go, right?

912
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,434
All right, let's go.

913
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:09,311
-I'll go.
-Look.

914
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,771
It wasn't meant for you.

915
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,273
-Then who?
-The 17th?

916
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,735
You had Korean street food with Jae-won
at a place called Auntie's.

917
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,363
Try to remember what you ate
as much as possible.

918
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:22,199
The answer is on the next page.

919
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,077
What was it?

920
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:26,579
-Hey, Jae-won.
-Hi.

921
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,247
Hi.

922
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,090
That scared me! What was that?

923
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,141
What are you doing?

924
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:56,150
-It's pretty cute.
-It is.

925
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:06,243
FIREWORKS FESTIVAL

926
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:07,828
JAE-WON, JI-MIN, TAE-HUN
MEETING AT THE ENTRANCE AT 7:30 P.M.

927
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,430
Have fun tomorrow for both of us!

928
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,653
A MIDSUMMER NIGHT FIREWORKS FESTIVAL

929
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:54,792
Hi.

930
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:56,210
Hi,

931
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:58,003
Kim Jae-won.

932
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,008
You look pretty.

933
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:10,641
-Seo-yoon!
-Kim Jae-won!

934
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:12,518
-Ji-min!
-Hey.

935
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:14,979
-What took you so long?
-Why are you so late?

936
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:16,605
-We're not late.
-You look so pretty today.

937
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,192
Come and look.

938
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:24,154
It's a tarot reading
for "love advice and fortune."

939
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:25,489
-What?
-"Love fortune."

940
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:30,035
Enjoy.

941
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,578
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

942
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:33,080
-Here.
-Thanks.

943
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,666
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

944
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:37,751
This is so good.

945
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:39,545
It looks spicy.

946
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:43,590
-You want some?
-Yeah.

947
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:46,427
I'll sit on it.

948
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:50,264
We still have some time
before the fireworks.

949
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:52,933
Do you want to check out that side?
We haven't seen it yet.

950
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:55,436
-Over there? Sure.
-All right.

951
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:56,895
-Hey.
-What?

952
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:58,564
Do you want to get ice cream?

953
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:01,525
Ice cream? Sounds good.

954
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,444
Let's get ice cream.

955
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:09,158
Hey, Seo-yoon.

956
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:10,367
Yeah?

957
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:12,953
Why don't we check out that side?

958
01:12:13,954 --> 01:12:14,788
Okay.

959
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:15,789
Yeah.

960
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:26,508
COUNTRY'S LARGEST CRUISE FIREWORKS SHOW

961
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,470
Please watch your step. It's slippery.

962
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:02,521
I don't want to forget this.

963
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:11,780
You won't forget.

964
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,004
No memory…

965
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,591
ever completely disappears.

966
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:34,553
That's what I believe.

967
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:44,271
I…

968
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:50,152
I think I broke the third rule.

969
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:53,322
I broke it…

970
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,201
a long time ago.

971
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:45,332
HAN SEO-YOON

972
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:47,543
CHECK IMPORTANT NOTES
IN THE "JOURNAL" FOLDER

973
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:53,173
ALARM

974
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:14,278
YOU HAVE MEMORY DISORDER FROM AN ACCIDENT
CHECK YOUR COMPUTER ON THE DESK!

975
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:16,822
ALWAYS KEEP THE NOTEBOOK IN YOUR BAG

976
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:19,366
BE CAREFUL AT SCHOOL!
ONLY YOUR FRIEND JI-MIN KNOWS!

977
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,307
-Is this for real?
-I'm blocking you right away.

978
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:44,808
Stop lying, man.

979
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:47,603
I'm blocking your move.

980
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,438
Gi-hun. Throw it here!

981
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:51,982
-Go, go!
-Hand it over!

982
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:54,109
It seems right to split it like this,
but you shouldn't.

983
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:55,944
The word "gatda"

984
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,155
is a compound of "ga,"
meaning "to go," and…

985
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:02,242
Not long until senior year now.

986
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:03,660
I know.

987
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:06,246
I guess we won't be able to
have fun anymore.

988
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,205
Probably not.

989
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,292
I'd love to go on another outing.

990
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:13,128
Remember when the three of us went to
the aquarium and fireworks festival?

991
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,589
Yeah, we did.

992
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,594
I'm getting a bit hungry.

993
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:22,679
Do you want some tteokbokki
on the way home?

994
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,598
Yeah, sounds good.

995
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:26,350
-I'm down.
-Let's go.

996
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:30,771
Should we go to Auntie's?

997
01:17:30,854 --> 01:17:31,730
Sure.

998
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:34,107
I'm excited. The food there is so good.

999
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,067
I know, right?

1000
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:50,207
All I can offer you now is

1001
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:56,213
Good night, good dream, goodbye

1002
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:00,926
Good night, good dream…

1003
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,848
Senior year came in the blink of an eye.

1004
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:11,728
Well, everything does for me, but still.

1005
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:13,522
That's the third time you've said that.

1006
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:15,691
Is it?

1007
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:18,985
When you go to college,

1008
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:21,822
I'll still be a high school student.

1009
01:18:21,905 --> 01:18:24,533
Who will I hang out with then?

1010
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:25,909
You can go to college too.

1011
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:27,953
Why not apply to art school?

1012
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:29,371
Art school?

1013
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,458
Do you really think I can go to college?

1014
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:34,876
Of course.

1015
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:36,336
Actually,

1016
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:38,880
I've been drawing a lot lately.

1017
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:42,426
Let's see it.

1018
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:43,385
Hold on.

1019
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:51,810
By any chance…

1020
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:56,440
do you know who this is?

1021
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,527
Take a look. Do you recognize him?

1022
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,199
It's strange.

1023
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:07,743
I keep drawing him for some reason.

1024
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:13,415
Do you not recognize him?

1025
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,172
Who could it be?

1026
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:24,676
I know this might sound funny…

1027
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:27,512
but…

1028
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:30,932
he somehow feels familiar.

1029
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:38,190
Whatever.

1030
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:43,904
I have a favor to ask you.

1031
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:46,656
You see,

1032
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:50,535
I was born with a weak heart.

1033
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:54,748
So, I've been getting
regular checkups and everything.

1034
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,125
But recently,

1035
01:19:57,209 --> 01:20:00,253
it suddenly got a lot worse.

1036
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:03,381
So…

1037
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,261
I thought…

1038
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:10,472
Just in case…

1039
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,351
I thought I should ask you ahead of time.

1040
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:16,228
If you're about to say
something ridiculous, don't.

1041
01:20:19,022 --> 01:20:19,981
I promised…

1042
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:25,237
to make Seo-yoon happy

1043
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,571
day after day.

1044
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:32,702
But I don't know
how much time I have left.

1045
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:35,497
I could collapse at any moment.

1046
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:39,918
You're going to be fine.

1047
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:44,548
Nothing's going to happen.

1048
01:21:17,163 --> 01:21:20,208
KIM JAE-WON

1049
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:24,546
The person you're trying to reach
is unavailable.

1050
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:26,172
You'll be charged after the beep.

1052
01:21:45,567 --> 01:21:46,651
Hello?

1053
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:48,236
Hi, Ji-min.

1054
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:35,575
Thank you.

1055
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:39,829
Thank you, Ji-min.

1056
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:43,249
My goodness.

1057
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:48,964
Thank you for coming.

1058
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:17,993
Are you okay?

1059
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:00,201
If I die…

1060
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,457
If I die…

1061
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:09,794
erase me from Seo-yoon's journal.

I WENT TO KARAOKE WITH JAE-WON

1070
01:25:37,048 --> 01:25:38,216
JAE-WON WAITED FOR ME BY THE GATE

1071

-Listen, honey.
-Yeah?

1082
01:28:19,502 --> 01:28:21,587
Is there anything you want to ask us?

1083
01:28:22,213 --> 01:28:24,799
You've been having trouble
sleeping lately.

1084
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:29,429
No, I fell asleep
pretty quickly last night.

1085
01:28:29,512 --> 01:28:30,346
That's a relief.

1086
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:47,113
There's no medical explanation for it
at this point,

1087
01:28:47,196 --> 01:28:49,574
but the fact that your symptoms
are getting better

1088
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:51,200
is definitely a good sign.

1089
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:54,120
It's been a hard journey.

1090
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:55,872
Thank you.

1091
01:28:55,955 --> 01:28:57,498
Whether it's an image

1092
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:59,959
or a feeling of some kind,

1093
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:01,919
if anything comes to mind,

1094
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:04,130
try to dig deep and explore it.

1095
01:29:05,214 --> 01:29:06,049
Okay.

1096
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:09,093
Have you left the hospital?

1097
01:29:09,635 --> 01:29:10,636
What did your doctor say?

1098
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:12,805
She said my symptoms are getting better.

1099
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:14,682
Really?

1100
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:17,643
Oh, I'm so glad.

1101
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:22,774
My memory hasn't been resetting
for the past few days,

1102
01:29:23,566 --> 01:29:25,860
but I still don't remember anything
from after the accident.

1103
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,114
I feel like

1104
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:34,285
I'm still forgetting something important.

1105
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:37,580
It'll get better, right?

1106
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:55,765
I still can't remember who he is,

1107
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:58,434
but I thought maybe I'd remember
if I kept drawing.

1108
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:56,826
I'm sorry.

1109
01:31:15,428 --> 01:31:22,435

1115
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:31,003
What…

1116
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:33,464
is this?

1117
01:32:50,439 --> 01:32:53,818
DON'T FORGET KIM JAE-WON

1118
01:33:12,169 --> 01:33:14,005

1123
01:33:56,172 --> 01:33:57,131
Will you go out with me?

1124
01:33:59,091 --> 01:33:59,967
Okay.

1125
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:02,553
I'd like that. Let's go out.

1126
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:05,806
-I'm going to start messing with you.
-Wait a minute.

1127
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:07,683
Hey! You can't do that.

1128
01:34:08,809 --> 01:34:09,643
What?

1129
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:11,562
Where are you going?

1130
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:14,857
All I can offer you now is

1131
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,526
Good dream

1132
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:22,615
This is Jae-won's secret spot.

1133
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:25,409
It's just a beach, actually.

1134
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:26,911
But you said it was your secret spot.

1135
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:27,828
That's true.

1136
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:33,751
Oh, be careful.

1137
01:34:36,962 --> 01:34:38,381
You must be hot. Have some water.

1138
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:40,508
Thanks.

1139
01:34:49,767 --> 01:34:50,810
Hi.

1140
01:34:50,893 --> 01:34:51,727
Hi.

1141
01:34:51,811 --> 01:34:53,396
One, two, three.

1142
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:54,480
Say cheese!

1143
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:57,024
It's a video.

1144
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:59,193
-Oh, come on!
-Jeez.

1145
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,505
UNDERSEA GLASS STUDIO

1146
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:23,717
FOR RENT

1147
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:35,980
Hello.

1148
01:35:47,032 --> 01:35:47,867
Well…

1149
01:35:48,742 --> 01:35:51,829
I wasn't sure
if I should give this to you or not.

1150
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:57,251
But I think you should have it, Seo-yoon.

1151
01:36:00,212 --> 01:36:01,088
Right.

1152
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:23,235
I think deep down,

1153
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:25,863
Jae-won…

1154
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:30,075
wanted to leave
a part of himself with you.

1155
01:36:34,872 --> 01:36:35,789
I'm sorry.

1156
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:41,337
I don't even remember him.

1157
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:44,340
Seo-yoon.

1158
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:48,511
As time goes by,

1159
01:36:49,303 --> 01:36:51,347
everyone's memories start to fade.

1160
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:56,852
But what remains in your heart…

1161
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:00,231
never changes.

1162
01:37:39,603 --> 01:37:40,437
Seo-yoon.

1163
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:41,897
Kim Jae-won!

1164
01:37:43,607 --> 01:37:45,693
But it's a crab, so it moves sideways.

1165
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:47,820
-Hi!
-Hi.

1166
01:37:47,903 --> 01:37:48,946
Hello.

1167
01:37:50,447 --> 01:37:52,950
Gosh, it's stunning.

1168
01:38:56,889 --> 01:38:58,265
You won't forget.

1169
01:39:00,059 --> 01:39:01,310
No memory…

1170
01:39:04,229 --> 01:39:06,106
ever completely disappears.

1171
01:39:11,695 --> 01:39:12,863
That's what I believe.

1172
01:39:14,406 --> 01:39:16,367
Let's come back here sometime.

1173
01:39:16,867 --> 01:39:18,410
Okay, let's come back.

1174
01:39:39,932 --> 01:39:41,600
Scars don't disappear.

1175
01:39:44,436 --> 01:39:46,355
But the pain doesn't last forever.

1176
01:39:52,611 --> 01:39:53,570
If everyone else

1177
01:39:54,154 --> 01:39:56,448
is forgetting you little by little…

1178
01:40:00,077 --> 01:40:00,994
then I'll…

1179
01:40:02,955 --> 01:40:04,873
try to remember you little by little.

1180
01:40:52,921 --> 01:40:56,008
