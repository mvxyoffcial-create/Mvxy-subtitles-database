[Leah] No, you are not.

But it's yet another reminder
that I'm just a girlfriend, not a wife.

based on likes and dollars.

by using their faith.

a secular POV here at the show.

Easter, Halloween.

come on, guys, faith is hotter than ever.

326
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,583
People struggle
with love and relationships,

327
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,958
but isn't a meaningful connection
what we all want?

Sex definitely rates.

334

Lot of people are fans of that.

335
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,625
You're not actually considering this?

336
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:37,375

but I want to go out with a bang.

-[Curtis] Okay, everybody.

338
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,625
Let's get out there and bang.

339
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,875
That came out wrong. I hear it now.

340
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:45,666
All right, Leah,
you're gonna produce this with Jarrett.

341
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,958
What? We don't need
two senior producers on this.

342
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,333
And why? It's my story.

343
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:54,666
Leah recently pointed out to me
that when we challenge each other,

344
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,958
we reach the best outcomes.

345
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,041
Teamwork.

346
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,583
I love teamwork.

347
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,000
[lighthearted music playing]

348
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,083
-Good night.
-Good night, Leah.

349
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,416
-Heading out?
-[sighs]

350
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,583
No, just going for an elevator ride.

351
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,583
You always kept me on my toes.

352
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,500
Well, enjoy it for the five weeks
and three days you have left here.

353
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,666
Okay, are we gonna spar like this
the whole time?

354
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,708
If so, I need to cancel
my Sunday pickup games

355
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,250
and save my competitive edge
for our spicy little chats.

356
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,125
Or here's an idea.

357
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:29,541
We keep the dialogue to a minimum
and avoid each other as much as possible.

358
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:33,208
You don't have to be salty just 'cause
I got the jump on you with this story.

359
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,375
I'm not.

360
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,416
I'm excited to see
how your off-brand appreciation

361
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,041
for this Internet preacher pans out
or crashes and burns.

362
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,875
Ah, don't be like that, Caldwell.

363
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,541
-Hmm.
-You got something against God?

364
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,708
Just people who use Him to get a leg up.

365
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,875
I'm not using anyone.

366
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,041
This book changed me.

367
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,708
I hadn't thought about how cheating
and being messy was jamming me up.

368
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:57,333
[scoffs] So you're telling me you're
a reformed player, thanks to this book?

369
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,375
Yes. Absolutely.

370
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,416
My player card has been revoked.

371
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,125
Look, it's a great book
and a slam-dunk story,

372
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:10,083
so either shoot the ball
or ride the bench, Le-Le.

373
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:13,041
-Don't call me that again.
-[elevator bell dings, doors open]

374
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,958
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

375
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,083
[button clicks]

376
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,000
Good night, Le-Le.

377
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,875
-She still wants me.
-[button clicks]

378
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,583
[Leah]
I can't stand him.

379
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:28,125
He's a king narcissist
who doesn't have one ounce of humility.

380
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,791
He thinks he's always right.

381
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,541
[chuckles] And you don't?

382
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,041
I'm nothing like Jarrett.

383
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,041
[chuckles] I must have you confused

384
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,375
for another friend
who thinks she's always right.

385
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,041
I can't help it if I'm usually right.

386
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,666
Usually?

387
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,166
Often.

388
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:44,708
Always.

389
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,708
[chuckles] Okay,
we'll keep that between us.

390
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,083
Just remember what Dan said.

391
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,166
I have to show the higher-ups
I can play well with others. I know.

392
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,333
And you will.

393
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:53,791
Just keep your cool.

394
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,500
Don't let Jarrett get under your skin.

395
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,750
I'm sure that's what he wants.

396
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,958
To get a rise out of me,
knock me off my game.

397
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,125
Little does he know,

398
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:04,333
-I'm going scorched earth!
-[door closes]

399
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:07,291
Oh, hey, girl, Ayden just got home.
I got to go.

400
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,250
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

401
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,833
Hey, baby. You busy?

402
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,083
Oh. No. Not at all.

403
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,958
[chuckles] I can give you
as much time as you need.

404
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,208
Okay. Come take a seat.

405
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,500

Boom.

408
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,916
Just got it out of the repair shop.

409
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,125
-Your championship ring.
-Mm-hmm.

410
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,750
Polished it a little.

411
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,791
You know, it's kind of crazy
this'll probably be my last one.

412
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,750
Yeah, I'm not gonna get a ring
when I'm calling games next season.

413
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:42,375
[sighs] I know it's tough
when you don't know what the future holds.

414
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,416
Well... what would I do without you?

415
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Hmm?

416
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,583
[both chuckle]

417
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,166
-Mwah.
-Huh.

418
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,166
All right, so, gonna put this in the safe.

419
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,500
-Yeah.
-Make sure she knows I cherish her.

420
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,375
-Yep. Yep. Yep.
-Right? Okay. All right.

421
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,916
-[chuckles] Okay.
-I'm gonna take a shower.

422
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,208
-Okay. [chuckles]
-I'll be back.

00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,666
-Okay, we have that in common, fitness.
-Yeah.

428
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,708
-Do you like running?
-Oh, my God, I love running.

429
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,583
I just finished running
the Boston Marathon last year,

430
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,958
and I'm training to do New York next.

431
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,875
-Wow, I just love me a good marathon.
-Mm-hmm.

432
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,291
Like, 40 miles? Easy, right?

433
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,000
-Give me 60. [laughing]

-[phone beeping]
-Uh...

435
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,291
Oh. It's probably just my trainer.

436
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,083
[stammers] Go ahead, take it.

437
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,333
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah.

438
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,375
Actually, do you mind
if I just... really...

439
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,000
-Just got to use the washroom real quick.
-No, that's fine.

440
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,166
I'll be right here.

-Hi.

He paid the bill.
Would you still like your food?

446
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,083
What do you...

447
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,833
[stammers] He left?

448
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,291
Yeah.

449
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,875
Yeah. Yeah. I'll just get it to go.

-Cool. Thank you.

Good morning.

Welcome back.

455
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,500
Now, while the human event business
remains bustling,

456
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,833
many people are getting in on the fun
by throwing birthday parties,

457
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:42,541
obedience school graduations and
even elaborate weddings for their pets.

458
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,750
Dogs are getting wifed up,
and I cannot find a man.

This is my life, you guys.

460
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,333
You've spent a lot of time and money...

461
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,041
I played with the order for the photos.

462
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,625
You'll see,
it's much more dynamic this way.

463
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,916
It better be, since I don't have time
to change it back.

464
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,708
Let's just hope our special guests
stay on their marks, guys.

-It's party time.
-So cute. And how about yours?

469

his graduation day as much?

470

-That is enthusiasm. Yeah. [chuckles]
-Oh. Oh.

475
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,500

that's a lot of enthusiasm.

[phone clicks, video stops]

489
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,750
Let's jump in.

490
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,541
I drafted a list of interview questions
for Michael Todd.

491
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,083
That's it?

492
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,708
No small talk? A little tête-à-tête?
That's French.

493
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,208
Je suis pas intéressée.

494
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,541
That's French.

495
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,000
That was impressive.

496
00:19:56,083 --> 00:20:01,250
Can we focus and figure out this bad idea
you convinced my boss to sign off on?

497
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,041
Okay, our boss.

498
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,666
And you're still on that?
Did you even read the book?

499
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,958
All this book's doing is
dusting off the Scriptures

500
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,875
and dressing up the Bible
with some down-home lingo

501
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,208
and acting like it has all the answers.

502
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,541
Well, at least it has some answers.

503
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,416
Besides, Michael Todd's not
the only pastor presenting the Gospel

504
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,291
in a relevant and progressive way,
but he's the one that's straight fire.

505
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,041
Fire-fire-fire.

506

507
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,583
Let's just do the work and have our booker
reach out to Michael Todd's team

508
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,291
to see when he can fly in
for the interview.

509
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:32,916
Oh, no, I already spoke to Dan.

510
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,166
We're clear for next weekend
to go to Tulsa.

511
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,750
-Excuse me?
-Yeah.

512
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,000
We need to see the pastor in his element.

513
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,375
His family, his church, his followers,
the whole shebang.

Um, where are you going?

516
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,666
What do you care? You seem to have
forgotten we're producing this together.

517
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,750
You know, fine.

518
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,125
I'll see you later tonight
for drinks with Dan.

519
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,791
He invited you?

520
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:02,875
Super.

521
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,875
[laughing]

522
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,916
No need to dance around it.

523
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,416
I know you called Roland to see about
clearing my schedule March 3rd.

524
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,958
-Yes, I did.
-Mm.

525
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:24,083
I want you to come to the cemetery
with me this year.

526

[wistful music playing]

527
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:28,958
[Leah chuckles softly]

528
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,875
I paid my respects at the funeral.

529
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:38,041
If you want to go, I get that,
but it's not for me.

530
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:44,541
It would mean a lot to me
for us to honor your mother together.

531
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,916
I'm sorry, Dad.

532
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,208
I don't want to upset you,
but I can't go there.

533
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,583
Leah, you've been throwing yourself
into work ever since we lost her.

534
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,125
But you can't outrun grief.

535
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,041
Mourning is a process.

536
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,625
It would help if we just...

537
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,083
if we just go there and sit with the pain

538
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,583
than to try to shut it out.

539
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:12,791
I love you, and this banana pudding
is so bomb, but...

540
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:16,041
[sighs] I don't have time
to deal with this right now.

541
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,625
I have a man to destroy.

542
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:19,791
You're dating someone?

543
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:21,708
What?

[Dan recorded]
Sorry, guys,
something came up at the last minute.

549
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:36,375
I trust you'll make good use
of the bonding time.

00:22:40,083 --> 00:22:41,541
He sure did.

553
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:45,041
I guess now's a good chance
to catch up outside of the office.

554
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,125
Hmm.

555
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:52,458
How is it, anyway, that we've never run
into each other once in all these years?

556
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,500
Easy. I don't hang out at places

I-I ain't even see the gun.

560
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:07,291
I've also avoided you, since I've had
no desire for our paths to cross.

561
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,500
Yeah, uh, about that.

562
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:12,708
Back then, I was young and foolish,

563
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:17,166
but I learned that real manhood
is found in commitment.

564
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,583
-Really?
-Yes.

565
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:22,250
How so?
Are you in a committed relationship?

566
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,500
Well, not yet.

567
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,791
Meaning you're still a player.

568
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:29,166
It's not one or the other.

00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,541
Okay, look.

I am truly sorry I hurt you.

577

But I'm walking a different path now.

578
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:52,625
I'm supposed to believe that?

579
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:56,125

[sighs] Easy for you to say when you're
trying to take something else from me.

583
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,916
If you're really sorry, quit.

584
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,916

Okay, uh, are you-you trying to
convince me, or is someone else listening?

[sighs] I need a drink.

593
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:40,333
And I already took the liberty
of ordering for us.

00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:41,875
Whiskey, rocks?

595
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,875
Oh, we won't be needing that one.

you gonna do next, huh?

something suspicious in my bag?

Don't tempt me with a good time.

625
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:04,000
Funny you should say that,
because Roland booked us together,

626
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:07,125
so apparently he thinks I'm a good time.

627

Michael Todd and his lovely wife Natalie.

641
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,791
Thanks for joining us.

642
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,458
-We're so happy to be here.
-We're happy to be here.
-Oh.

643
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,750
-This should be good.
-It's going to be great.

644
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,916
Now, Michael, why do you think
your message about relationships

645
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,250
has continued to resonate
with people so strongly?

646
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:57,208
Well, Brenda, I think it's because
relationships are hard.

647
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,958
Dating is hard.

648
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:03,416
Especially with all the constant messages
that we're getting on social media and TV,

649
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,291
the images, which makes it harder.

650
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,583
-Yeah.
-And this message is

651
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:09,833
-to really help people find their aim.
-I love it.

652
00:27:09,916 --> 00:27:12,458
I am sensitive to lactose,
and this shit is cheesy.

00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,000
Then pop a Lactaid.

654
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:15,500
This isn't a takedown.

655
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:19,416
[Michael]
Fixing your aim is actually
changing the focus from the superficial

656
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,208
and putting the focus on
the things that actually really matter

657
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:25,083
to make a successful relationship.

658
00:27:25,166 --> 00:27:26,625
-[Brenda] Wow.
-[Michael] What are their core values?

659
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,916
-Do they actually have character?
-Mm-hmm.

660
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,291
This is one thing I've found out,
is you can't Facebook faithfulness,

661
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,541
and you cannot Instagram integrity.

662
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,666
Great.

663
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,750
Enough with the softballs, Brenda.

664
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,250
[Jarrett]
Ignore her, Brenda.

665
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,375
Ask him,

666
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:45,416
what if someone's aim is off
but they think they're doing fine?

667
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,708
[Brenda]
What if a person is

668
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:50,083
dating around and they don't think
they need to change?

669
00:27:50,166 --> 00:27:52,416
Well, then I got to talk about
chicken nuggets.

670
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,291
-[laughs] Okay.
-Now, just go with me for a second.

671
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,750
-Chicken nuggets?
-Imagine that there was

672
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,958
chicken nuggets being passed around,

673
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:02,541
and everybody is putting
their beautiful hands into this bucket,

674
00:28:02,625 --> 00:28:04,583
touching them, nibbling on them,

675
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:07,125
taking pieces
and then putting it back in there.

676
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:08,666
-Ugh.
-The question is:

677
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,250
Would you want
one of those chicken nuggets?

678
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,291
No, I would not. [laughing]

679
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,666
Oh, my God. [chuckles]

680
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,375
I'm a nugget?

681
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,958
...but I promise you,
it's gonna leave you feeling empty.

682
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:21,166
What if that person's just empty?

683
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,333
-Or what if they're full of it?
-[Brenda]
That's why you recommend

684
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:24,875
-dating intentionally, right?
-[Michael] Yes.

685
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,166
Okay, talk to me about that.

686

that's cute and cut up...

687
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,250
Mm.

688
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,000
...or every baddie with a body.

689
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,208
Ooh, as tempting as it may be.

690
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,541
-Dig deeper, Brenda.
-[Jarrett] Ignore her and stay on track.

691
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:37,875
Don't listen to him!

692
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:39,791
[Jarrett]
Why are you
all up in my mic, yo?

693
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,625
Because you're only using it
to make a glorified promo reel.

694
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:43,750
This isn't
To Catch a Predator.

695
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:44,958

-Uh...

696
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:47,041
-[arguing continues]
-So, this really sounds wise, right?

697
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,375
All of this advice, but...

698
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,458
Ask him if he thinks he's oversimplifying

699
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:52,541
-relationship dynamics.
-[Jarrett]
Jesus, take the wheel.

700
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:53,708
-You're impossible.
-[Brenda] Relationships--

701
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:55,750
Well, you're a walking red flag
who's afraid of commitment!

702
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:58,583
And you're a narcissistic perfectionist
who's as stubborn as an ox.

703
00:28:58,666 --> 00:28:59,708
How 'bout that?

704
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,375
Goodbye.

705
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:02,458
Look what you did!

706
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:05,166
Okay, you've been trying
to trash this story from the start.

707
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,583
So, what if one person wants
to get married, though,

708
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:10,250
and the other person doesn't?

709
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,041
Asking for a Frienda.

710
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:18,166
If you've been dating
three, four, five, God forbid, six years

711
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,708
-and there's no forward momentum...
-[Natalie] Mm-hmm.

712
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:23,791
[Michael] ...you need to step back
and ask yourself:

713
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:27,250
Is this the relationship
that God wants me to be in?

714
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,416
Is this God's will for my life?

715
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,666
And maybe you need to ask
the even tougher question:

716
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,583
Does this relationship need to end?

717
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,041
Brenda, are you okay?

718
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:46,250
I just need to pray on this
and sort myself out.

719
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,916
It's just one man's opinion.

720
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,208
Yeah, maybe. I don't know.

721
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:51,291
I have to be honest.

722
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,291
The thing that I keep worrying about is:

723
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,208
Is it God's will, and is it time
to end the relationship?

724
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,041
I'm sorry.

725
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:00,416
Ladies, we are not okay.

726
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:04,916
You're a mess. You're a mess. I'm a mess.
We are all three hot messes, okay?

727
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,125
This book is speaking to me.

728
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,458
I've been reading it.

729
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:10,958
-You mean decorating it?
-[Treese] I'm being serious.

730
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,625
I think that we all need to fix our aim.

731
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:15,416
Yeah, I'm-I'm good.

732
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,625
My aim is...

733
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:18,750
-[blows softly]
-[Treese] Yeah?

734
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:20,166
When's the last time you dated someone?

735
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,458
Yeah, like, actually dated,
more than a week or two,

736
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:24,375
'cause you never give anyone a chance.

737
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:27,333
Work is my focus,
but if I found someone who fit The List--

738
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:28,708
-The List.
-The List. Yes, we know.

739
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:32,541
It is my masterpiece in progress
guiding me towards my perfect man.

740
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:35,416
This book says that
you need to rip up The List.

741
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,458
I'm not ripping up anything.

742
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:40,500
Do you know how long
it's taken me to curate that?

743
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:46,291
What if all the things that you think
you want are actually holding you back?

744
00:30:46,375 --> 00:30:48,500
You are really drinking the Kool-Aid.

745
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,833
Yeah. I'm chugging it.

746
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:52,125
-[chuckles]
-Okay, look.

747
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:55,875
"Have you ever known a girl
who dated pretty much any guy

748
00:30:55,958 --> 00:31:00,166
who happened to show an interest in her
without ever stopping to think about

749
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,583
the kind of guy
who would really be right for her?"

750
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:05,083
Mm.

751
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:08,500
"Or a couple
who have dated for a long time

752
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,041
and have gotten so comfortable with it

753
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:12,750
that they aren't making
any move towards marriage?"

754
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:16,083
Ooh, that book is a wake-up call.
[chuckles]

755
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,750
You know, I-I was really trying to be
the "go with the flow" chick,

756
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:21,041
but I can't do that anymore.

757
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:24,875
And I can't just keep going out
with every guy who swipes right.

758
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:25,958
Mm.

759
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,875
I got to try this.

760
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:30,833
Chapter four. It's the nugget chapter.

761
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,333
"Intentional Dating."

762
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:36,791
Yep. And I need to reread chapter five:
"Does It Need to End?"

763
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:41,500
-Seriously, nothing speaks to you?
-[scoffs]

764
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:44,291
Like the chapter about
unpacking to repack?

765
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:47,041
You don't think that
you need to fix your aim?

766
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:51,750
While I appreciate the concern,
my aim is clear.

767
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:56,250
I'm going to kick Jarrett Roy to the curb,
land my promotion,

768
00:31:56,333 --> 00:32:00,708
break the glass ceiling,
and then everything will be great.
