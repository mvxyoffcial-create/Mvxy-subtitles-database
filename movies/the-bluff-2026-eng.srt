how does a captain

come by a piece of gold bearing my mark?

Issac. Careful, my boy.

Let's get those braces on.

Come.

Any sign of father's ship?

No.

59 days now.

Hey.

125
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,958
Your father's been late his whole life.

126
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,125
Man late to our own wedding.

127
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,500
- (chuckles softly)
- Ask me,

128
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,458
he is right on time, hmm?

129
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,416
Then why are they sending
another vessel to go search for him?

130
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,958
Your Auntie Lizzy tell you that?

131
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,083
(sighs)

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,166
He will come home.

133
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,833
He always does.

134
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,625
Hmm?

135
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,083
Yeah.

136
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,250
I will pack my belongings
and meet you by the cove at first light.

137
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,375
- (pounding on door)
- The cove.

138
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,458
- Mm-hmm.
- (Ercell) Lizzy.

139
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,333
(whispering) Hide, hide, quick.

140
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,625
Lizzy!

141
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,250
Morning, Ercell.

142
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,916
Morning's long gone.

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,375
Everything all right?

144
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,958
Of course. Why?

145
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,291
You were supposed to be watching
the coconut sweets for Issac's birthday.

146
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,958
(sighs) It slipped my mind.

147
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,833
- (Ercell) Oh, really?
- (Elizabeth) Apologies.

148
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,333
I'll make another batch.

149
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,583
No need. I should've done it myself.

150
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,125
Nice day out.

151
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,208
(goat bleats)

152
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,125
Same as yesterday
and pretty much every other day.

153
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,541
Never seen anyone so burdened
to live in paradise.

154
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:58,083
I have spent my whole life
on this tiny island.

155
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,125
Is it so bad
that I long to see the sunrise

156
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,625
from another shore just once?

157
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,083
Have you ever felt that?

158
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,916
Too much work to daydream.

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,958
Also, watch what you say
in front of Issac.

160
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,916
- (sucks air through teeth)
- Don't kiss your teeth at me.

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,500
(sighs) You're not my mother.

162
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,416
No wonder T.H. is always gone.

163
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,916
(sighs)

164
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,458

(grunts)

167
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:46,125
(Issac) On this day to God we pray,

00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:19,666
I am the Custode,
and this is an emancipated British colony.

334
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,291
Kindly state your name,
rank and allegiance.

335
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:29,041
(Connor) Such a fragile thing, paradise.

336
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:33,166
One day sunshine, the next...

337
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,958
(whooshing)

338
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:40,041
...a raging hurricane slams ashore
like God's own fist.

339
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,166
Uh... I ask you again.

340
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,458
Name, rank, allegiance.

341

347

348
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,125
Weston?

349
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,875
Do not mess about!

350
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,875
(seagulls squawking)

351
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,875
(flies buzzing)

352
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,375

- (happy chattering)

356
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,708
Harbormaster!

357
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,833
Look to the headland!

358
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,875
(jaunty tune continues)

359
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,083
(hushed) Get all the people
into the church.

360
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,541
(blowing deep tone)

361

00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,125
(conch shell blowing in distance)

364
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,916
(boy) Look there,
coming through the channel.

365
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,083
(Custode) <i>Heard tell</i>
<i>of a mad Captain Connor.</i>

366
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:19,750
Sea robber, war hound,

367
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,250
wanted enemy of the British Empire.

368
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:26,458
Who do you fancy built that empire?

369
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,791
(pirates grunting)

370
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,500
Pull, my fine hearts!

371
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,291
Pull!

372
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,083
Heave for mommy!

- (Custode)<i> Them sailors...</i>

<i>...them with you?</i>

375
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,000
Aye.

376
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:43,500
Unfortunately, they do not share
my sense of diplomacy.

377
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,083
We come to settle a debt.

378
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,583
Where is the wife of T.H. Bodden?

379
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,083
Miss Ercell?

380
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,916
(sucks teeth) I cannot allow
no armed regiment

381
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,333
for a damned fishwife.

382
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,458
(Connor) No one else need be harmed.

383

(panicked clamoring)

385
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,250

(intense music playing)

389
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,375
Tell your men to stop rowing.

390
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:25,083
I don't know what pact Connor make with
the devil, but it does not stand here.

391
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,166
(sniffing)

392
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,291

(pirates grunting)

397
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,125
Lift oars!

398
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:46,875
Steady.

399
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,041
Fire.

400
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,041
(gunshot, bullet whizzing)

401
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,500
And it was such a pretty island.

402
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,583
(grunts)

403
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,875

(groaning)

405
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,291
He looks so fancy there.

406
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,375
(both laughing)

407
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,875
(Ercell) You know my husband?

408

(grunting)

409
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:09,916
Is he alive?

410
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,458
Hey. Collect some items
before the others come.

411
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,541
Aye.

412
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,708
Who are the others?

413
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,416
String her up.

418
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,625
There's a child down there.

419
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,166
Stop. STOP!

420
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,291
Look at me.

421
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:49,041
Who taught you how to speak Chichewa?

422
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:52,291
The same person that taught me this.

(snarling)

837
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:27,166
Issac, what are you doing?

838
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,291
(tense music playing)

839
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,250

840

(muffled grunting)

841
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:36,375
Look away.

842
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:38,333
(shouts)

843
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:41,291
Enough of this jungle shite.

844
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:45,375
Bloody, Bloody Mary!

845
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:47,541
(echoing) Bloody Mary!

846
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:50,291
(bird squawking)

847
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,375
I'm told you have a beautiful new family.

848
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,625
I wonder...

849
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:00,833
...do they know who you really are?

850
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:02,250
(tense music playing)

851
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:03,791
Does your boy?

852
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:07,250
Hear me, sonny.

853
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:10,958
We are not the ones
you should be afraid of.

854
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:12,458
(scattered chuckling)

855
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:15,791
Lay down your arms.

856
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:19,458
Let us make restitution
for your transgressions.

857
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:21,291
What say you, Mary?

858
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:23,666
(Ercell grunts)

859
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:27,958

- (pirates whispering)
- (tense music playing)

862
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:37,458
All right, then.

863
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:40,333
Perhaps a barter...

864
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:45,208
...for the life of
Captain Theodore H. Bodden.

865
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,958
Even now he sits aboard my ship,

866
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:52,083
waiting in earnest.

867
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:55,250
A family reunion, then?

868
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:58,041
The cottage.

869
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,666
Dusk.

870
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:04,041
You and my gold.

871
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,250
Or it'll be his head at your feet.

872
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:10,958
(Elizabeth crying softly)

873
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:13,500
Acknowledge me, sailor!

874
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:19,958
Aye!

875
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:27,166

(Issac grunting)

878
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,000
(Elizabeth) Where are we going?

879
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,500
To the only safe place on the island.

880
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:51,958
(machete hacking)

881
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:53,833
Let's go.

882
00:48:55,291 --> 00:48:57,458
(grunting)

883
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:00,500
Come.

00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:04,833

885
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:06,791

887
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:19,125
(Issac) Whoa.

888
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,500
(Elizabeth scoffs)

889
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:32,500

890
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:35,708

(gasping)

892
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:42,083
What on earth?

893
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:46,291
It looks like a schooner.

894
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,541
(Ercell) Eyes up, sister.

895
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:57,541
Sister-in-law.

896
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:08,083
Watch your step.

897
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:13,208
Where did all this come from?

898
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,291
Here, there.

899
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:19,916
Mostly there.

900
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,250
(grunting)

901
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:26,666
- (Elizabeth) Ercell.
- (sighs)

902
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,958
Who was that horrible man?

903
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:32,291
And how are you so good at killing people?

904
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:36,250
His name is Francisco Connor.

905
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:40,291
He was a colonizer
for the East India Trading Company

906
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:41,916
and a notorious buccaneer.

907
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,375
Like the ones in my book?

908
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:45,791
No. Those are tales.

909
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,041
Real pirates are murderers, not heroes.

910
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:53,500
(pirates chattering)

911
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,958
She really as lethal as they say?

912
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:57,208
(Scout) Yeah.

913
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:59,833
Ask those poor buggers
we left in the swamp.

914
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:04,583
Mm. We be expecting extra coin
for this cock-up, Mr. Quartermaster?

915
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:06,333
Do your duty.

916
00:51:06,416 --> 00:51:08,458
There'll be plenty to go around.

917
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:10,833
Well, I ain't afraid of no scag.

918
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:13,750
Big mouth…

919
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:17,625
While you were sucking on your mum's teat,

920
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:21,583
that scag was a bona fide terror.

921
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:25,958
Had her own ship,
side by side with Connor.

922
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:29,583
<i>Till she stabbed him, stole his gold</i>

So how do you know them?

925
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:38,083
Ercell.

926
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:41,166

Whoa.

929
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:51,125
We were indentured servants.

Speak freely, Mr. Lee.

986
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:05,041
That is our true prize.

987
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:09,416
Bloody Mary is a means to an end.

01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:05,625
The one on the manifest?

1172
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:08,750
I know it.

1173
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:12,000
I know everything about you.

1174
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,791
(strained grunting)

1175
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:22,250
- Mercy.
- Mercy.

1176
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:23,791
- (pirate) Blimey.
- (pirates whispering)

1177
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:26,583
Bring him.

1178
01:06:26,666 --> 01:06:28,666
(pirates chattering indistinctly)

1179
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:34,833
- (pirate) Move.
- (Bodden) Get your filthy hands off me.

1180
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:41,833
(Connor) Well, Captain...

1181
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,250
...it's been a pleasure.

1182
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:46,625
Hardly.

1183
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:52,875
Oi, Bodden.

1184
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:58,916
Why don't you take a couple of bars.

1185
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,625
For the widows of your crew.

1186
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:02,083
- (Ercell) Don't listen to him.
- (pirates chuckling)

1187
01:07:02,166 --> 01:07:03,291
Eyes on me.

1188
01:07:03,875 --> 01:07:05,000
Please.

1189
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:09,000
Now, darling, to our other business.

1190
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:13,625
The matter of your betrayal.

1191
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:18,208
How shall we balance those scales?

1192
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:21,458
- I took what I was owed.
- Owed?

1193
01:07:21,541 --> 01:07:22,708
When I found you,

1194
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:24,458
- you were a weak little girl...
- Never weak.

1195
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:29,041
...bound for a life of servitude
in some Englishman's brothel.

1196
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:32,041
But I took pity on you. I saved you.

1197
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:33,916
Made you powerful, strong.

1198
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:39,166
And for that, you stabbed me in the ribs
and robbed me.

1199
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:40,958
Sorry.

1200
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:43,000
I was aiming for your heart.

1201
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:44,875
(chuckles mirthlessly)

1202
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:49,208
Then I failed to teach you proper.

1203
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:53,291
A mistake I shall surely remedy...

1204
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:56,833
...with your bandy-legged boy.

1205
01:07:56,916 --> 01:07:58,416
- No!
- (Bodden) Bastard!

1206
01:07:58,916 --> 01:08:01,083
- (grunting)
- (pirates shouting)

1207
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:04,416
- (explosion)
- (screaming)

1208
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,750
Get the bloody gold!

1209
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,333
(pirate yelling)

1210
01:08:08,416 --> 01:08:09,708
(grunts)

1211
01:08:12,833 --> 01:08:14,166
Ercell!

1212
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,375
- (explosion)
- (pirates screaming)

1213
01:08:22,083 --> 01:08:23,958
(pirates shouting and screaming)

1214
01:08:26,375 --> 01:08:27,875
(screaming)

1215
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:30,625
- (Connor grunts)
- (Bodden cries out)

1216
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:33,500
(screaming)

1217
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:35,250
(Quartermaster yelling) Enough!

1218
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,541
(grunting)

1219
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:55,541
Wait. Wait!

1220
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:58,000
Connor, I yield. I yield.

1221
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:04,666
Your quarrel is with me.

1222
01:09:06,416 --> 01:09:07,833
Leave him be.

1223
01:09:07,916 --> 01:09:09,291
(quietly) Ercell.

1224
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:10,916
Run.

1225
01:09:11,666 --> 01:09:13,208
(Ercell) I'll do anything you ask.

1226
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:19,416
Between the ribs.

1227
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,375
That's how it's done.

1228
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:25,000
No. No!

1229
01:09:25,083 --> 01:09:26,166
(Ercell cries out)

1230
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,166
(Ercell) No!

1231
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,708
(strained grunting)

1232
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,166
<i>Mon trésor.</i>

1233
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:34,250
(gasping)

1234
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:35,875
(somber music playing)

1235
01:09:36,625 --> 01:09:38,041
Hear my voice.

1236
01:09:40,708 --> 01:09:43,750
I'm here with you.

1237
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:47,041
(gurgling breath)

1238
01:10:01,166 --> 01:10:02,625
(tense music playing)

1239
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,666
(whimpering)

1240
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:06,916
You!

1241
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:10,791
(breathing heavily)

1242
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,083
You think I would just let you slip away?

1243
01:10:14,166 --> 01:10:15,708
- (yells)
- (grunts)

1244
01:10:21,208 --> 01:10:22,875
(cries out in pain)

1245
01:10:23,875 --> 01:10:25,458
(grunts)

1246
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:30,583
Why did you betray me?

1247
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:36,083
Why couldn't you just
take the fucking gold?

1248
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:39,875
That gold is to pay my crew.

1249
01:10:41,625 --> 01:10:43,958
What I came for

1250
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:47,541
is the bounty on your head.

1251
01:10:47,625 --> 01:10:49,458
(scoffs)

1252
01:10:50,666 --> 01:10:52,250
(grunts)

1253
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,291
(sizzling)

1254
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:58,041
Fall back! Fall back!

1255
01:10:58,125 --> 01:11:00,000
- (pirate) Fire in the hole!
- (Ercell yelling)

1256
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:03,291
- (explosion)
- (pirates yelling)

1257
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:05,583
(pirates groaning)

1258
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:07,041
(Ercell yelps)

1259
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:11,916
(grunting)

1260
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:16,291
(breathing heavily)

1261
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:21,916
(Elizabeth) Listen to this.

1262
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,750
T.H. was a dockhand.

1263
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:27,541
They met here on Cayman Brac.

1264
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:31,291
<i>She was in hiding after stealing the gold</i>

1265
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:33,416
<i>and fighting her way free</i>

1266
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,916
from Connor's fleet.

1267
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,375
(intriguing music playing)

1268
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:39,375
(grunting, breathing heavily)

1269
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:42,458
(groaning)

1270
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:44,250
(Elizabeth and Ercell) August 12th.

1271
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:47,666
(Ercell) <i>This tiny island is a paradise.</i>

1272
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:50,458
(crying out in pain)

1273
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:52,791
(Ercell) <i>I am finally free.</i>

1274
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:56,250
(breathing heavily, grunting)

1275
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:59,583
(Ercell) <i>Here, I shall forge a new life</i>

1276
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:02,541
<i>and find a new purpose.</i>

1277
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:04,583
She changed her name to Ercell.

1278
01:12:04,666 --> 01:12:06,666
What is her real name?

1279
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,041
Um...

1280
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,125
(Issac) Can you read that?

1281
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:14,166
(chuckles) No.

1282
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:15,625
(bag thuds)

1283
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:18,875
(grunting, breathing heavily)

1284
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:28,541
- (muffled shouting)
- (pensive music playing)

1285
01:12:41,541 --> 01:12:44,250
(Quartermaster speaking indistinctly,
muffled)

1286
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:46,416
(muffled) What is this?

1287
01:12:47,625 --> 01:12:50,875
(clearer) Captain, I said,
what in the ratbag shit is this?!

1288
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,000
Our mission.

1289
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,875
Our mission was the bars of gold,

1290
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:00,000
now blown to dust!

1291
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:03,875
Not your sick obsession with that woman.

1292
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:06,625
Mind your tone, friend.

1293
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:08,416
We've lost the gold.

1294
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,708
We lost the bounty.

1295
01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:14,625
My boy is gone! For nothing!

1296
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:18,875
And I will not throw another sailor's life
into the jaws of death

1297
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:21,500
for this madness.

1298
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:23,708
Madness?

1299
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:26,708
That khat leaf muddled your brain.

1300
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:30,000
You lack perspective, Quartermaster.

1301
01:13:31,083 --> 01:13:33,375
- Bring my boy.
- (pirate) Aye.

1302
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:35,625
All hands, take our fallen to the ship!

1303
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:37,416
(pirate) Quickly, go.

1304
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,333
They deserve a proper burial.

1305
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:40,916
Belay that order!

1306
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,666
(murmuring)

1307
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:46,125
(Quartermaster) I will then assemble
the remaining crew

1308
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:48,375
and vote on how to proceed.

1309
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:52,583
This campaign is over.

1310
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:55,125
(pirates talking quietly)

1311
01:13:57,958 --> 01:13:59,708
- It's mutiny, then?
- (gun clicks)

1312
01:14:01,791 --> 01:14:05,500
The penalty is quite clear.

1313
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:09,791
(Quartermaster) All these years,

1314
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:12,041
to shoot me in the back?

1315
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:13,625
(scoffs)

1316
01:14:16,666 --> 01:14:18,791
(grunts)

1317
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:20,000
(murmuring)

1318
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:33,375
Go to your ancestors.

1319
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:35,166
(gunshot echoes)

1320
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,416
(pirates murmuring)

1321
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:58,666
Our dear quartermaster was unable to see
the true value of Bloody Mary.

1322
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:03,458
The golden age of piracy is done.

1323
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,791
Our kind has been betrayed.

1324
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:10,833
We, who ran the waves red
for king and country...

1325
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:14,666
...are now branded as criminals.

1326
01:15:18,083 --> 01:15:20,541
We filled their coffers,

1327
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:25,125
built their colonies, but, alas...

1328
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:30,583
...their modern world no longer
holds accord with our ways.

1329
01:15:31,666 --> 01:15:33,708
But despair not.

1330
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:41,666
The bounty I seek
is worth more than any gold.

1331
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:49,250
I hold here a decree from three empires

1332
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:53,625
offering the captors of Bloody Mary
a lifetime pardon.

1333
01:15:53,708 --> 01:15:56,125
(murmuring)

1334
01:15:56,208 --> 01:15:58,833
No more running, no more scavenging.

1335
01:15:58,916 --> 01:16:02,916
All our sins washed away
in a court of law,

1336
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,208
with immunity to sail the seas
like conquistadors of old.

1337
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:10,166
On that, you have my oath!

1338
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:19,666
- But...
- (flames whooshing)

1339
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:25,458
...do I have yours?

1340
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:28,791
Are we vagrants of the sea...

1341
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,166
- (pirates grumbling)
- ...cast asunder?

1342
01:16:31,916 --> 01:16:33,750
Or are we one mind,

1343
01:16:33,833 --> 01:16:37,708
with one hand, with keen steel
wielded by one captain

1344
01:16:37,791 --> 01:16:42,083
who gives purpose to your corrupt souls?

1345
01:16:42,166 --> 01:16:44,041
- (pirates) Aye!
- Libertas!

1346
01:16:44,125 --> 01:16:45,833
(pirates) Libertas!

1347
01:16:45,916 --> 01:16:47,958
- Libertas!
- Libertas!

1348
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:49,500
(cheering)

1349
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:51,291
Come!

1350
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:55,208
(pirates chanting) Libertas!
Libertas! Libertas!

1351
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:59,833
Libertas! Libertas! Libertas! Libertas!

1352
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:02,083
(Connor) For the long night ahead.

1353
01:17:02,166 --> 01:17:05,208
(pirates shouting)

1354
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:06,541
(grunting in pain)

1355
01:17:06,625 --> 01:17:08,583
- (Elizabeth) Forgive me.
- (groaning)

1356
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:10,208
Muma, rum.

1357
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:14,375
(panting)

1358
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:22,583
(grunting in pain)

1359
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:26,250
What happened?

1360
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,875
(sniffles)

1361
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,208
I failed you.

1362
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,583
(moans)

1363
01:17:38,791 --> 01:17:40,125
(sniffles)

1364
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:45,125
Your father is gone.

1365
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:47,291
(Elizabeth and Issac crying)

1366
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:49,375
(mournful music playing)

1367
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:02,041
- (pirates talking indistinctly)
- (tense music playing)

1368

(grunting)

1369
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:15,416
Captain!

1370
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,625
Steady on, lads.

1371
01:18:19,166 --> 01:18:22,458
I have as many friends in hell as you do.

1372
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:25,958
(pirates shouting angrily)

1373
01:18:30,833 --> 01:18:32,750
(Ercell groans in pain)

1374
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,833
They're gonna find us

1375
01:18:37,916 --> 01:18:39,708
and they're gonna kill us.

1376
01:18:40,708 --> 01:18:42,708
(paper rustling)

1377
01:18:47,916 --> 01:18:50,375
Did you really do
all these terrible things?

1378
01:18:54,625 --> 01:18:56,000
Yes.

1379
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I'm all that they say I am.

1380
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:00,833
And worse.

1381
01:19:04,333 --> 01:19:06,000
That might be...

1382
01:19:07,666 --> 01:19:10,291
...but you are also a mother

1383
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:12,541
and a sister.

1384
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:15,791
And right now, we need all of you,

1385
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:18,833
or we will not live this night.

1386
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:20,916
(pensive music playing)

1387
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:25,583
Is this your real name?

1388
01:19:32,583 --> 01:19:35,625
He took everything from you.

1389
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:41,541
(pages rustling, closes book)

1390
01:19:41,625 --> 01:19:43,583
It's time to take it back.

1391
01:19:49,083 --> 01:19:51,083
♪ ♪

1392
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:57,083
(Ercell grunting) It's only a matter
of time till they find these caves.

1393
01:19:57,166 --> 01:19:59,083
We have to survive till sunrise

1394
01:19:59,166 --> 01:20:00,916
and then light the signal pyre.

1395
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,041
Why not light it now?

1396
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:06,916
Day is the best chance
for the British Navy to track the smoke.

1397
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,333
What if they don't make it in time?

1398
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:11,541
We could all escape in the catboat.

1399
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:14,791
If I leave, Connor follows.

1400
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:19,625
This only ends with the sand soaked
in his blood or mine.

1401
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:25,875
You stay here. I need to prepare.

1402
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:32,375
You don't have to do everything yourself.

1403
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:34,541
(Issac) Yeah, Muma.

1404

(pulsing music playing)

1405
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:45,750
You do exactly as I say,
and no backchatting.

1406
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:47,000
I never backchat.

1407
01:20:47,083 --> 01:20:48,750
Backchatting right now.

1408
01:20:49,916 --> 01:20:51,333
Listen carefully.

If anything happens,

1432

I want you to take the catboat
and sail to the Big Island.

1433
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:21,375
Look for the British regiment.

1434
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:23,375
- Muma, I cannot sail.
- Yes, you can.

1435
01:22:23,458 --> 01:22:25,416
You know the charts,
you know the currents.

1436

The sea is uncertain.

1437

Listen to me, boy.
