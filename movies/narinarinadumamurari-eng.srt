1
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,391
Where are you going, brother?

2
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,150
-Come on, come on.
-How can I move without telling where?

3
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:05,275
Hurry it up.

4
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:08,358
I'm getting the bride.
Everything alright?

5
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:10,666
Okay! Okay!

6
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:12,620
-Is this about love?
-Yeah!

7
00:02:12,904 --> 00:02:13,900
The auspicious time is
6:30 in the morning.

8
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:16,383
My friend said he'd bring the car,
but he didn't.

9
00:02:17,016 --> 00:02:18,058
Don't stress, man.

10
00:02:18,475 --> 00:02:19,683
I'll be faster than a car.

11
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,725
Mind if I help?

12
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,266
Why take the risk? Keep going.

13
00:02:23,513 --> 00:02:24,648
I'm a love failure, bro.

14
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,555
I thought I'd help others in love.

15
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:29,402
-What's your name?
-It's Lovekusa.

16
00:02:29,602 --> 00:02:30,831
I'll go as far as it takes, for love.

17
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,821
You don't have to go far. We've arrived.

18
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:34,248
Stop right now.

19
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:57,516
-Do you have a ladder?
-No, it's not there.

20
00:02:57,749 --> 00:02:59,124
Is it time to find a ladder, bro?

21
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:01,501
-Then how do we climb?
-Climb on me.

22
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,560
My shoes are muddy.

23
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,177
Love's like mud.
I'm past it. Don't think.

24
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,201
-Climb on me.
-As you wish.

25
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:07,980
Wait there. I'm coming.

26
00:03:09,681 --> 00:03:11,168
It's all for love. It's okay.

27
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,426
Wait, we are coming.

28
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:17,014
-Did anyone see you?
-Nobody.

29
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:18,162
By the way, where's Karthik?

30
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:19,983
-What are they doing?
-He's getting ready. You okay?

31
00:03:20,396 --> 00:03:22,436
Bro, you can continue
talking after you get down.

32
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,693
For love's sake, can't you do this?

33
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:26,388
-Come on, hold me.
-Hey!

34
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,747
The girl's eloping. Wake up and go.

35
00:03:29,924 --> 00:03:32,507
-They're starting too, bro!
-Come on, hurry up!

36
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:33,376
Let's go.

37
00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:35,587
Hurry up!

38
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:54,179
Hey, move it, man!

39
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:56,565
Ah!

40
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,487
Ah!

41
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:12,070
I see some cattle there.

42
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:14,887
I can't see a thing!

43
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,856
-Be careful, man.
-Careful!

44
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,852
Hey, careful! Look!

45
00:04:23,361 --> 00:04:25,145
-Hey! Be careful.
-How did this happen?

46
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:28,843
-Hey, be careful, man!
-Hey!

47
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:30,302
-Put it down, man!
-I am unable to, bro.

48
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:33,542
-Do it.
-I'll turn right giving an left indicator.

49
00:04:33,586 --> 00:04:34,914
I will see how would they catch us.

50
00:04:41,304 --> 00:04:42,661
Come on. Start getting ready.

51
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,693
Wishing you a happy married life, dear.

52
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:44,884
-Thank you.
-God bless you.

53
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:47,200
Sorry, bro.
Your auto got damaged because of me.

54
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,659
It's alright sir.
I, Lovekusa, was born for love's sake.

55
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,186
You're a good man. Please come.

56
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:54,061
-Please bless the newlyweds.
-It's alright, bro.

57
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,755
-You carry on.
-Come on, bro. You are being too shy.

58
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:58,296
-Is everything okay?
-Everything's ready, dude.

59
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,250
Take care of the guest.

60
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:01,178
What are you staring at, bro?

61
00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:02,906
-He meant the guest?
-That's me.

62
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:04,824
-Let's go.
-What's your name, bro?

63
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:06,245
-It's Jackie.
-I didn't ask your name.

64
00:05:06,545 --> 00:05:08,659
-The priest's name is Harichandra.
-Why do I need the priest's name?

65
00:05:09,171 --> 00:05:10,834
-I would like the bridegroom's name.
-Karthik!

66
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:13,403
-What is the bride's name?
-Pallavi!

67
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:15,868
Karthik weds Pallavi!

68
00:05:16,205 --> 00:05:18,673
The names match well.
Let us go and see. I mean the marriage.

69
00:05:20,063 --> 00:05:21,767
-Where is the bridegroom?
-The bridegroom...

70
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:25,793
Here comes the bridegroom!

71
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:35,169
I feel shy, son.

72
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:36,616
What? The bridegroom is an old man?!

73
00:05:36,871 --> 00:05:39,072
Have we gone through all this
chasing for a child marriage?

74
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,336
Bro,
if Gurajada Apparao were alive today,

75
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:43,093
he'd be outraged by this
injustice and swing his slipper.

76
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:44,089
Son, who is he?

77
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,258
He helped with the chase.
He's our guest's dad.

78
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,310
-Hey, bro! Thank you.
-Don't call me bro--

79
00:05:49,113 --> 00:05:50,520
You're helping this wedding,
even knowing he's the father's age?

80
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,928
What's wrong with it?
They're in love and have exchanged hearts.

81
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:57,998
At the age of a heart transplant,
what's with exchanging hearts, bro?

82
00:05:58,198 --> 00:06:00,221
-Life is too short!
-She's very young, too.

83
00:06:00,488 --> 00:06:03,535
Live life your way, not by others',
that's what life is.

84
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:04,621
-So...
-Am I right, Dad?

85
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:06,506
So, you'll marry this
little girl to that old man?

86
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:08,940
This sin won't be forgiven.
You'll never get married in this life.

87
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:10,511
-This is the curse of Lovekusa.
-Bro!

88
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:11,731
-Take him away!
-Mr. Priest! This curse strikes you too!

89
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,965
-You will go mute while chanting.
-Don't worry, Dad.

90
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,190
People will always gossip,

91
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:16,474
-just ignore them. Sit!-Hey, stop it!

92
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:19,395
Don't do it, man! Don't ruin her life.

93
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,789
I've heard of inter-caste
and inter-religious marriages,

94
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,054
but what kind of 'middle-ground'
marriage is this?

95
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:26,371
-Wait, man!
-Leave me, guys.

96
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:28,170
People are watching!

97
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:29,798
Please don't ruin that
little girl's life.

98
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:30,638
Chinnu, do you want to, or should I?

99
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:32,454
-I will throw it.
-You will do it? Okay, do it.

100
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:39,289
Five minutes, bro. It'll be done.

101
00:06:39,594 --> 00:06:45,485
-[holy chants]
-Finally, it's done.

102
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:46,366
Oh God!

103
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,765
-Sir, show Arundhathi star for the bride.
-Okay.

104
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:53,163
He's searching now, when will he find it?

105
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:55,722
Look, girl! He won't find it.
You search and show him

106
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,696
Karthik! There it is!

107
00:06:57,963 --> 00:07:00,064
-Where is it, Chinnu?
-There! It's visible right there.

108
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:01,107
Here, Dad! Take it!

109
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,379
Love you, dear!

110
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:05,357
They say that when the right time comes,
a son will be born.

111
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:09,577
There it is!

112
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:21,397
Listen, these days people are
divorcing over every little thing.

113
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:25,316
To take your case,
the reason must not be silly.

114
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:27,020
It's not silly reason, Sir.

115
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,334
-Then, what exactly is the problem?
-She's snoring! I can't sleep.

116
00:07:31,626 --> 00:07:34,524
She can't cook and always
orders from Swiggy or Zomato,

117
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:36,384
half my salary goes there!

118
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:40,176
She'll be on WhatsApp until midnight.

119
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:43,908
If I question her,
she says she's just checking statuses.

120
00:07:44,946 --> 00:07:48,078
If he sees that I'm online,
he'll be online too, right, Sir?

121
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:49,883
Tell me, who were you chatting with?

122
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,692
Sir, question him,
who is he chatting with?

123
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:53,338
Yes! Who were you chatting with?

124
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:55,584
-I'm checking statuses, Sir!
-Hey!

125
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:00,773
Sir!

126
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,471
-Sir!
-What?

127
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:05,073
Sir, your friend Venkatakrishna
has come to meet you.

128
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,645
-Why has he come?
-I don't know, Sir.

129
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:09,054
He can't stand it when
someone else is happy.

130
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:12,324
-Call him.
-OK, sir.

131
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:14,526
What, Ramalingam?

132
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:17,437
I guess you make a lot of money
by breaking couples apart.

133
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:20,518
-That Benz parked outside is yours, right?
-Have you started getting jealous again?

134
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,284
-Why are you here?
-To talk about my daughter's divorce.

135
00:08:24,558 --> 00:08:27,719
It hasn't even been a year since
they got married. Why a divorce?

136
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:31,920
It's a love marriage,
so it happened without my consent.

137
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,549
Anyway, these days,
do girls even listen to their dads?

138
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:38,473
They've been on the phone with
their boyfriends for hours.

139
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,780
When asked, they give the girls' names.

140
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:42,084
We truly believe that.

141
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:45,392
They go out shopping.
When asked, they give the girls' names.

142
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,230
Girls have become experts
at fooling their dads.

143
00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:51,853
-You have a daughter, right? Be careful.
-Hey, stop it!

144
00:08:52,523 --> 00:08:56,122
Don't say anything more.
Not everyone is like your daughter.

145
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:57,065
Oh!

146
00:08:57,306 --> 00:08:59,651
My Nithya wouldn't do
anything without my knowledge.

147
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:04,377
I was saying this exact line
until just the other day.

148
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:05,507
Hey, don't annoy me.

149
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:08,168
I've raised my daughter
differently from you.

150
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:10,812
Bring your daughter here in two days.
We'll discuss the case.

151
00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:12,146
Okay!

152
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:15,026
Your upbringing or mine

153
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:17,375
when it comes to eloping,
everyone’s upbringing is the same.

154
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:18,591
Tell me?

155
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:28,481
Very good.

156
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:32,991
Yeah, I know exactly what you're saying.

157
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:34,709
-Nithya!
-Yes!

158
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,533
Yeah, okay!

159
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:40,283
That's OK.

160
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:43,571
They've been on the phone with
their boyfriends for hours.

161
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:45,986
When asked, they give the girls' names.

162
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:50,471
Sir, your signature.

163
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:54,002
These points are okay.
These are also okay.

164
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:58,017
-Nithya!
-What happened, Dad?

165
00:09:58,217 --> 00:10:00,499
-Who's on the phone, dear?
-It's Gautham, Dad.

166
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:03,079
-Gautham? Okay.
-Okay.

167
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:06,972
Did you hear?
My daughter won't lie to me.

168
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:09,976
-She's genuine.
-It's the way you raised her, sir.

169
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,738
-Dear, Nithya!-Yes, Dad!

170
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:17,363
You're coming to Rajesh Uncle's
birthday party in the evening, right?

171
00:10:17,635 --> 00:10:19,456
Sorry, Dad, I'm going out with a friend.

172
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:23,813
They go out shopping.
When asked, they give the girls' names.

173
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,099
-With whom? Is it with Pooja?-No, Dad. It's with Gautham.

174
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:30,687
Oh, yes... fine, okay.

175
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:32,434
-Yes, Dad.
-Okay! Take care. Be safe.

176
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:33,387
-Bye!
-Bye!

177
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,681
Have you noticed how
genuine my daughter is?

178
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:40,249
-True, sir.
-She's a darling.

179
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,813
-Hello, Nithya.-Yes, dad.

180
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,996
I'm done with the work at the bank.
Shall we go to a movie, dear?

181
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:53,501
Sorry, Dad. Plans have changed.
I'm going out with Gautham.

182
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,074
Oh with Gautham? Okay, dear! Take care.

183
00:10:57,274 --> 00:10:58,770
-Be safe. Okay? Bye.-Okay, dad. Bye.

184
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:02,792
Have you noticed how
genuine my daughter is?

185
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:04,455
Yes, she is truly genuine, Sir.

186
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,517
-Come, Nithya!
-Coming, Dad!

187
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:08,753
Time's up.

188
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:12,387
Hurry up.

189
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:15,192
Want to sit here?

190
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:19,204
Actually, Dad,
I'm going out to a party with a friend.

191
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:22,333
-Oh, is it? Is it with Gautham?
-Yeah!

192
00:11:22,752 --> 00:11:24,491
-Okay! Go... Enjoy!
-Bye, Dad!

193
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:26,494
-Thank you!
-All the best. Bye.

194
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:31,042
Hey, Srinu, notice how genuine she was,
telling the truth and then leaving?

195
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:32,689
What's with this 'telling the truth,'
Sir?

196
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:34,272
Are you okay with her
eloping and being honest?

197
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:35,487
-Hey!
-Then what, Sir?

198
00:11:35,687 --> 00:11:36,502
She's going out with him,
always on the phone...

199
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:39,449
always on the phone,
doing whatever he says.

200
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:41,195
Movies, parties, everything is with him.

201
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:44,042
Once you call her and ask,
"Is Gautham your friend or boyfriend?"

202
00:11:50,353 --> 00:11:51,388
-Hi, Dad!
-Hi!

203
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:52,666
-Good morning! Hello!
-Good morning!

204
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:53,418
-Good morning.
-Hi, ma'am!

205
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:55,079
Come on. Is your jogging going well?

206
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:57,093
-Going well.
-Very good!

207
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:58,677
-Coffee?
-Yes, please!

208
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:05,100
Who is this Gautham, dear?

209
00:12:05,645 --> 00:12:08,833
You talk to him on the phone,
and you go shopping with him.

210
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:11,579
Is he your friend or your boyfriend?

211
00:12:12,388 --> 00:12:13,695
-Dad, that's...
-Hey!

212
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:15,537
Don't feel bad about saying it.

213
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:16,974
Can I suggest something to you?

214
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:20,002
If he's just a friend,
put two sugar cubes in your coffee.

215
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,011
If he's your boyfriend, add four.

216
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,249
-Thank God, he's just a friend.
-Yes, sir.

217
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:37,302
Dad, the sugar cubes are finished.

218
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:41,543
-Wait a minute, I'll bring it.
-Hey, why? Can't you get it?

219
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,599
Dad, Gautham and I are in love.

220
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,407
I was going to tell you about this.

221
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:49,847
But in the meantime...

222
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:52,895
Okay, ask Gautham to come home tomorrow.

223
00:12:53,219 --> 00:12:54,741
-Okay, Dad!
-Post-Lunch?

224
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:56,608
-Okay?
-Thank you!

225
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:14,001
-Hi, Nithya!
-Gautham, why were you so late?

226
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:18,383
-Dad has been waiting for you for so long.
-Why were you so tense? I'm here, right?

227
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,146
-Where is he?
-In the lawn.

228
00:13:20,412 --> 00:13:21,560
-Come, let's go.
-Gautham...

229
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,383
please speak cautiously.

230
00:13:24,712 --> 00:13:26,655
Chill, I'm there, right?

231
00:13:29,637 --> 00:13:31,470
Hello, sir. I'm Gautham.

232
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:36,262
The house construction is good.
It's nice.

233
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:40,390
-I asked you to come post-lunch.
-Yes!

234
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,370
Why are you here at four 'O' clock?

235
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:45,328
I usually have lunch at three,
so I came here after that, sir.

236
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:47,628
What do you do?

237
00:13:47,712 --> 00:13:49,587
I studied engineering and now
work as an architect, sir.

238
00:13:49,803 --> 00:13:51,095
Then why did you study engineering?

239
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:54,637
Not just me, no guy who studied
B.Tech can answer that question.

240
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:56,752
-What's your monthly income?
-It's sixty thousand!

241
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,263
Do you know my daughter's income?
I know, sir. It's three lakhs.

242
00:14:01,512 --> 00:14:02,865
In that company, they're recruiting
people without any knowledge,

243
00:14:03,065 --> 00:14:04,274
for lakhs of rupees, sir.

244
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:06,851
Actually, I'm planning to
join that company next month.

245
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:10,558
-Hello! Excuse me!
-Well, I'm the one without talent, sir.

246
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:13,600
What did you love about my daughter?

247
00:14:17,972 --> 00:14:19,747
-Her eyes are beautiful, sir.
-What else?

248
00:14:21,205 --> 00:14:23,111
-That waist, sir!
-Hey!

249
00:14:23,826 --> 00:14:25,615
Sir, if I say more,
you'll be upset as a father.

250
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:27,101
No! Go to the next question, sir.

251
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:28,743
Tell me what you dislike about her.

252
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:31,647
Let's skip this, sir!

253
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:33,845
-It's okay, tell me.
-No, sir. You'll get hurt.

254
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,404
-Hey, I won't get hurt. Tell me.
-She keeps praising you, sir,

255
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:38,647
saying, "My father is a hero."

256
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,626
-That irritates me a lot, sir.
-Hey!

257
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,718
As you asked me to be frank,
I told you honestly.

258
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,555
Before I agree to marry
my daughter to you,

259
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:49,325
I want to know you and
your love story in detail.

260
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:51,638
So tell me your entire love story.

261
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,069
Then I will decide.

262
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:54,769
She hasn't told you?

263
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:57,256
Oh no, I will tell you, sir.

264
00:14:57,477 --> 00:14:58,324
I came here for that.

265
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:02,465
Starting with Kerala,
it's the rainy season, sir.

266
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:07,169
But surprisingly,
there was no rain that day.

267
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:12,993
That day was Pournami,
sir, the full moon day.

268
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:19,108
Surprisingly, there was no moonlight.

269
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:22,796
Hey, leave the imagination to
me and just tell me the story.

270
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:24,396
Ah, straight to the point then.

271
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,415
Those were the days when
I was working in Kerala.

272
00:15:28,707 --> 00:15:31,870
Kerala is such a beautiful place,
you know it's called Own God's Country?

273
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,067
-God's Own Country...
-Yeah, right.

274
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,796
Backwaters, greenery, boats,
everything is beautiful there, sir.

275
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:42,775
But I have one small problem, sir,
they cook everything in coconut oil.

276
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:48,377
They use coconut oil in everything, sir.
The biryani, curries, even Maggi.

277
00:15:48,577 --> 00:15:50,927
Why did you bring up
your struggles in Kerala?

278
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,548
Sir, your daughter ended my struggles.

279
00:15:54,895 --> 00:15:56,808
For me, she is truly a goddess.

280
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:00,758
It made me sad to hear
that the Andhra mess

281
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,669
run by a Kerala cook had closed down.

282
00:16:03,857 --> 00:16:08,901
At that moment, I suddenly smelled the
spicy aroma of pulihora in my room.

283
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:13,491
I followed the smell and realized it
was coming from my neighbour's house.

284
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:20,043
Sir, that was the first time I
saw your daughter mixing pulihora.

285
00:16:20,243 --> 00:16:22,963
Wow! Awesome, sir!

286
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:28,301
When I saw her making
such perfect pulihora,

287
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:31,121
I felt her mother must
be an excellent cook.

288
00:16:31,834 --> 00:16:33,634
Uncle, is that the reason
you fell for aunty, right?

289
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,117
Hey, tell me your story, not mine.

290
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:41,270
Hello, do you speak Telugu?

291
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:44,939
I could sniff the pulihora...

292
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,830
That's when I realized your
daughter has a lot of pride.

293
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,810
-What?
-I meant to say that she is strict.

294
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:52,419
Tell me the story.

295
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:56,952
The end card for my bad days has arrived,
sir.

296
00:16:57,527 --> 00:16:58,283
[speaking in Malayalam]

297
00:16:58,723 --> 00:17:00,034
-Hi, ma'am.
-Hi!

298
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:02,479
[in Malayalam]: No matter what you
say in Malayalam, I won't understand.

299
00:17:02,685 --> 00:17:04,379
So we can talk about
anything and it won't matter.

300
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,106
[in Malayalam]: I want to spend
a lakh and sleep for one night.

301
00:17:07,716 --> 00:17:12,104
I want to be able to sleep whenever
I want for at least one night.

302
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,385
[in Malayalam]: Suji, the day before
yesterday, four spoons were missing,

303
00:17:20,668 --> 00:17:22,920
Yesterday, two plates and today,
the tea cup.

304
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:27,182
[in Malayalam]: Hey, Telugu dude,
watch your tongue around me. Got it?

305
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:29,806
-You stupid Malayali! Get lost.
-[in Malayalam]: Get lost, Telugu dude!

306
00:17:30,356 --> 00:17:31,416
-[in Malayalam]: You dal-and-saucer guy!
-Raising your voice at me?

307
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,140
-Enough. Don't cross the line.
-[speaking in Malayalam]

308
00:17:34,315 --> 00:17:36,652
-Your attitude has gotten worse.
-Excuse me!

309
00:17:36,852 --> 00:17:37,971
[in Malayalam]: Who is it?

310
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:39,929
Hey, pulihora!

311
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:41,762
What's the fight about?

312
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,892
I hired her to cook,
but she's been stealing spoons and plates.

313
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:47,045
She's a big magician and a skilled thief.

314
00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:49,159
Looks like you're good at Malayalam.

315
00:17:49,423 --> 00:17:51,309
If you're on the streets
looking for food,

316
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:53,089
you don't just learn Malayalam,
you quickly pick up any language.

317
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,179
-Can you help me?
-Yeah, tell me!

318
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,507
Some people at my workplace passed
comments on me in Malayalam.

319
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,068
I tried using Google Translate as well,
but it wasn't helpful.

320
00:18:01,268 --> 00:18:03,620
It must be a bad word,
since even Google couldn't answer.

321
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,873
Do you know bad words?

322
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:07,575
Who do you think I am, huh?

323
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,989
My aksharabhyasam began with bad words.

324
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:13,158
[in Malayalam]: I want to spend
a lakh and sleep for one night.

325
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,471
I want to be able to sleep whenever
I want for at least one night.

326
00:18:15,671 --> 00:18:17,272
-Leave it!
-No problem, tell me.

327
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,005
I called you that you'd
translate it to me.

328
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:22,070
They say your back looks great.

329
00:18:22,863 --> 00:18:24,071
If we dig deeper,

330
00:18:24,155 --> 00:18:26,641
the language was far worse than Munna's in
"Mirzapur."

331
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:27,981
I'll tell you if you want me to.

332
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:29,594
-Not required!
-Okay!

333
00:18:29,946 --> 00:18:31,395
-Okay, bye.
-Wait!

334
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:33,511
-Did you have your lunch?
-Not yet!

335
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:36,951
Order quickly, it's almost closing time

336
00:18:39,646 --> 00:18:42,778
Don't we know when to order?
Why is she giving unnecessary suggestions?

337
00:18:44,462 --> 00:18:45,991
Sir, I'm not feeling safe here.

338
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,603
-I'm leaving this project.
-Wait a minute, Nithya.

339
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:50,317
Get out from here, you Idiots.

340
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:52,877
Later, your daughter got them fired.

341
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:54,946
He even gave her a
warning before leaving.

342
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:56,973
[in Malayalam]: If you leave now,
It's not safe these days.

343
00:18:57,173 --> 00:18:59,195
I'll see how you go home
safely from tomorrow.

344
00:18:59,395 --> 00:19:01,185
You don't know who I am.

345
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:02,910
She couldn't understand even that.

346
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:05,391
She was in need of me again.

347
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,010
Hello, Fire Engine?

348
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:15,492
Hello,
why are you talking about a fire engine?

349
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:16,491
I'm cooking inside.

350
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:18,360
Is it the sizzler?

351
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,286
No.

352
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:21,328
The pressure built up
and the cooker burst.

353
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:23,870
How come you're here?

354
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:26,180
Do you want me to do any dubbing?

355
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,498
No, I need to learn Malayalam urgently.

356
00:19:29,698 --> 00:19:32,910
Can you teach me?
I need to understand office conversations.

357
00:19:33,146 --> 00:19:34,638
Please, help me!

358
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:40,053
Alright, but only if I get
50% of whatever you cook.

359
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,380
[in Malayalam]: Just say okay.

360
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:44,654
Okay?

361
00:19:45,638 --> 00:19:46,340
Okay!

362
00:19:47,571 --> 00:19:49,554
-And then?
-What else will there be?

363
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:55,491
She started cooking pulihora,
and I started charming her aura.

364
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:57,142
That's all. Simple...

365
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:11,005
"The girl, a Telugu beauty,
grace, like Lakshmi shines so bright"

366
00:20:11,717 --> 00:20:17,733
"The boy, a charming talker
wherever he is feels like delight"

367
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:25,051
"To any eye that gazes,
what joy in this lovely pair"

368
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:32,110
"No hint of love here just
friendship's gentle care"

369
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:38,963
"Like twin doves their
meeting flows, soft and fair"

370
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:46,746
"Oh wow, oh wow!
How perfect these hearts pair"

371
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:53,946
"Magic has cast its spell,
on the Kerala stage it plays so rare"

372
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:28,514
People you interact
with often use bad words,

373
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:30,637
so we should learn them first.

374
00:21:33,818 --> 00:21:40,344
"Is one word enough?
Sweetly spoken, solitude doesn't dare"

375
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:47,139
"Drop the pride,
softly now hearts entwine with care"

376
00:21:47,818 --> 00:21:54,276
"Blending taste and playful ways
like coconut breezes in the air"

377
00:21:54,892 --> 00:22:01,130
"Before each heart, whatever's read
moments light with fun to share"

378
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:08,776
"Oh wow, oh wow!
How perfect these hearts pair!"

379
00:22:08,985 --> 00:22:15,577
"Magic has cast its spell,
on the Kerala stage it plays so rare"

380
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,026
Your daughter has finally
mastered Malayalam, sir.

381
00:22:19,368 --> 00:22:21,618
I put on two kilos
because of her cooking.

382
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,190
Just when everything
seemed to be going well...

383
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:28,137
that Kerala workers
commented your daughter.

384
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,894
[in Malayalam]: Hey!
Would you like to eat?

385
00:22:32,094 --> 00:22:33,154
-Uh-hu!
-No?

386
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:36,606
You're always recording, right?
Do it now.

387
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,682
Record everything we do.

388
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,917
Do it!

389
00:22:42,352 --> 00:22:46,797
[in Malayalam]: Hey! Is there
anyone who knows or doesn't know?

390
00:22:46,997 --> 00:22:49,185
Hey! She speaks Malayalam!

391
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,518
Alright! Call anyone.

392
00:22:57,593 --> 00:23:00,177
What are you doing here? I was waiting
for you to make Gongura Mutton.

393
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:02,885
We discussed this lately,
didn't we? Hi! Who are they?

394
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:05,093
They're the ones who
passed comments on me.

395
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:06,427
Are you the ones who
passed those comments?

396
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,904
Hope you're good.
We'll meet again later. Get on.

397
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,714
I challenged them.

398
00:23:12,602 --> 00:23:13,484
About what?

399
00:23:14,343 --> 00:23:15,594
That you'd thrash them.

400
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:17,309
What day is it today?

401
00:23:18,018 --> 00:23:19,135
It's Saturday.

402
00:23:22,952 --> 00:23:24,895
Oh no!
Don't you know I don't beat anyone today?

403
00:23:25,095 --> 00:23:27,300
Give them back their bet.
Let's go. Hop on!

404
00:23:27,684 --> 00:23:29,118
You stuff yourself
every single day, right?

405
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:30,505
Can't you fight?

406
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:33,527
Don't talk about food.
Food is an emotion, isn't it?

407
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,005
Let's head back and cook something.

408
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:38,524
Looks like he's scared.

409
00:23:38,724 --> 00:23:39,653
Easy now. Let's go.

410
00:23:41,027 --> 00:23:42,547
Hey! Why did you hit him like that?

411
00:23:42,777 --> 00:23:46,417
I can stay calm when they comment
on me. But not when it's about you.

412
00:23:48,902 --> 00:23:51,443
[in Malayalam]: Guys,
get them. Beat them up!

413
00:24:01,052 --> 00:24:04,470
Hey! Don't tell me my daughter fell
for you after watching that fight.

414
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,686
That fight made her fall for me, sir.

415
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:08,389
Argh! The hell with my fate!

416
00:24:09,952 --> 00:24:11,445
[music mutes voice]

417
00:24:20,712 --> 00:24:22,344
Relax! Good boy.

418
00:25:09,248 --> 00:25:15,720
"Passing time looking at the clock."

419
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:22,793
"A beautiful magic happened
in the form of a divine bond."

420
00:25:23,592 --> 00:25:29,962
"The couple who met recently became one."

421
00:25:30,553 --> 00:25:36,946
"So much that both have
become one perosn only."

422
00:25:37,507 --> 00:25:44,212
"Oh wow, oh wow!
How perfect these hearts pair"

423
00:25:44,487 --> 00:25:51,140
"Magic has cast its spell,
on the Kerala stage it plays so rare"

424
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:58,425
[vocalizing]

425
00:25:58,873 --> 00:26:05,336
[vocalizing]

426
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,254
-That's how we came together, sir.
-But where's the love in this?

427
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,868
-What do you mean, sir?
-Where is the love here?

428
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:15,165
Do you know what title we
could give your love story?

429
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:18,861
-Prema Desam, Prema Prapancham.
-Akali Rajyam.

430
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,059
-Akali Rajyam?
-All you need is a girl who can cook.

431
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:25,582
And my daughter needs
a Malayalam teacher.

432
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,980
You came to me thinking this was love.

433
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,672
-This is pathetic.
-I mean...

434
00:26:30,947 --> 00:26:33,478
-Didn't you see love in our story?
-Love is fine.

435
00:26:34,322 --> 00:26:36,629
-Did you ever have a fight?
-No!

436
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,155
-Did you ever scold each other?
-No way.

437
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,447
-Did you ever stop talking to each other?
-Not at all.

438
00:26:39,738 --> 00:26:40,783
Have you ever blocked
each other's number?

439
00:26:40,988 --> 00:26:42,374
-Removed your display pictures?
-No, sir!

440
00:26:42,574 --> 00:26:44,489
-Were there any ego clashes?
-Why do ego clashes happen, sir?

441
00:26:44,947 --> 00:26:45,961
That's the point.

442
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:48,482
That means love never
truly started between you.

443
00:26:48,682 --> 00:26:49,657
What do you mean, sir?

444
00:26:49,963 --> 00:26:52,356
Between you, it's only nibba-nibby love.

445
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:55,902
Love is arguing,
then coming back together.

446
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,753
You should scold each
other and then say sorry.

447
00:26:57,953 --> 00:26:59,859
Love doesn't exist where
there are no problems.

448
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,727
If you never argue in love,

449
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,122
the first fight after
marriage will end in divorce.

450
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:08,817
This marriage won't last even a year.

451
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,188
I don't want my daughter
marrying you. You may leave.

452
00:27:17,944 --> 00:27:18,713
Sir!

453
00:27:20,127 --> 00:27:22,447
-We do have an issue, actually.
-What is it?

454
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:26,663
-It's you.
-Hey!

455
00:27:27,284 --> 00:27:28,357
Hey, stop! Come back.

456
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:31,779
Is your dad out of his mind?

457
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:33,735
He says there's no love without drama.

458
00:27:34,092 --> 00:27:35,941
He turned into a sadist,
separating families for a living.

459
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,768
Uh... sorry. Psycho.

460
00:27:38,537 --> 00:27:41,265
He thinks we're silly teenagers and
that there's no real love between us.

461
00:27:41,751 --> 00:27:45,244
I'm such a great son that
I married a 60-year-old man

462
00:27:46,104 --> 00:27:48,304
just because he was in love.

463
00:27:49,106 --> 00:27:50,670
But if a 25-year-old woman loves a guy,

464
00:27:51,076 --> 00:27:54,361
your dad suddenly becomes a sadistic,
egoistic man,

465
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:55,718
who can't spare ten
minutes to meet the guy

466
00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:57,490
Decide who you want to be with.

467
00:27:58,701 --> 00:27:59,576
Gauta--

468
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,540
We have reached the
hospital, get down, madam.

469
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:09,852
Careful, ma'am.

470
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:13,019
Have a seat.

471
00:28:14,857 --> 00:28:16,295
-I shall take a leave, ma'am.
-Take this money.

472
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:17,553
No, ma'am.

473
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:19,860
I've sinned recently.

474
00:28:20,193 --> 00:28:21,485
I'm in the process of repenting it.

475
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,592
I don't take money from pregnant women.

476
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:25,235
I'm not pregnant.

477
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:27,110
Wait, that's a tummy?!

478
00:28:27,443 --> 00:28:28,983
You walking doughnut!
You'll lose it if you walk.

479
00:28:29,183 --> 00:28:30,339
Why do you need an auto?
Give me the money.

480
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:32,599
-This society isn't letting me to be kind.
-Hey, Lova!

481
00:28:32,908 --> 00:28:34,703
-What are you doing here?
-And what about you?

482
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:36,947
You're here for a heart checkup?
Hey, where's cardiology?

483
00:28:37,191 --> 00:28:38,296
-What are you talking?
-That way, it seems.

484
00:28:38,535 --> 00:28:41,848
Hi, Mr. Karthik. Congratulations!
Your wife's three months pregnant.

485
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,447
Sweet news! Sweets on me!
Thank you! Thank you!

486
00:28:46,647 --> 00:28:47,664
But it's only been three
months since your wedding.

487
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:49,909
-Why are you so fast?
-Hasn't it been three months already?

488
00:28:50,074 --> 00:28:52,589
-How are you, brother?
-Please don't call me that.

489
00:28:52,943 --> 00:28:57,449
If this silly one calls me brother-in-law,
my weak heart won't survive.

490
00:28:57,656 --> 00:28:59,302
-Hey, my in-laws are here.
-I shall leave now.

491
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:01,576
Who informed them?

492
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:05,227
-I called them to surprise you.
-Aww! So sweet! Thank you.

493
00:29:05,976 --> 00:29:07,135
Please come in,
Mother-in-law and Father-in-law.

494
00:29:07,335 --> 00:29:08,926
How many times have I told
you not to call us that?

495
00:29:09,146 --> 00:29:10,967
Oh! Sorry Uncle, Aunty. How are you?

496
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,024
Hey, tell them, say it.

497
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:16,744
Mom, you're about to become
a grandma and you, a grandpa.

498
00:29:16,944 --> 00:29:17,671
I became a fool.

499
00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:21,089
Mom, he called you here so
we could take your blessings.

500
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:23,176
-Yes, Aunty. We need your blessings.
-Hey!

501
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:25,593
You'll get our blessings
only if you leave him.

502
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:26,935
Thanks to your foolish stunt,

503
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,726
we're so humiliated we can't
even hold our heads up.

504
00:29:28,926 --> 00:29:29,618
I mean, Aunty.

505
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:31,933
Is your head a handbag,
to just put it anywhere?

506
00:29:32,133 --> 00:29:34,246
We couldn't even sleep
peacefully because of you.

507
00:29:34,594 --> 00:29:35,735
Oh, damn. Uncle, wait a second.

508
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:37,067
I'll get you sleeping
pills from the pharmacy.

509
00:29:37,888 --> 00:29:39,961
-Careful. He might give you poison.
-By the way...

510
00:29:40,484 --> 00:29:41,610
This is Lovekusa, Uncle.

511
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,937
He's the one who brought your daughter
in his auto and got us married.

512
00:29:45,137 --> 00:29:47,743
If it weren't for him,
our love wouldn't have succeeded.

513
00:29:47,943 --> 00:29:50,096
Chinnu,
come let us go take the medicines.

514
00:29:51,385 --> 00:29:52,110
-You!
-How could you,

515
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:54,300
marry her off to an old man?

516
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,189
Oh no!

517
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,863
I swear,
I didn't know this clown was the groom.

518
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:00,444
If I had known, I'd have taken a U-turn
and dropped your daughter back home.

519
00:30:00,644 --> 00:30:02,648
Oh Lord!
Is there no redemption for this sin?

520
00:30:02,848 --> 00:30:04,178
-We have the redemption!
-We have the redemption!

521
00:30:04,378 --> 00:30:06,112
[indistinct voices]

522
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:09,734
-Aunt, one dosa.
-Coming right up.

523
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:11,018
Chinnu!

524
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:12,456
Son!

525
00:30:13,254 --> 00:30:14,286
I've got good news for you.

526
00:30:14,543 --> 00:30:15,189
What is it?

527
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,534
-I'm going to become a dad.
-Aren't you already one?

528
00:30:17,927 --> 00:30:20,095
Your dad's becoming a dad again.

529
00:30:20,532 --> 00:30:23,159
Your dad's faster than
Mohanlal in Bro Daddy.

530
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:24,179
Congratulations, Uncle!

531
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,500
Daddy!

532
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:27,646
-Congratulations.
-Love you son.

533
00:30:27,852 --> 00:30:29,178
-Congrats, Aunt.
-Thank you!

534
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:31,151
-I'm so happy for you.
-Gautham...

535
00:30:31,535 --> 00:30:33,035
-I have a small wish.
-Tell me, Dad.

536
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,955
I want to see my son and
your brother play together.

537
00:30:36,155 --> 00:30:37,357
I've done my part.

538
00:30:37,557 --> 00:30:40,091
What about you?
Did your father-in-law like you?

539
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,223
Why bring that up during a celebration?

540
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,616
And why would he like me anyway?

541
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:44,655
Son...

542
00:30:45,572 --> 00:30:47,644
This is normal for
people in love like us.

543
00:30:47,863 --> 00:30:50,647
If you're this upset, imagine how
your girlfriend must be feeling.

544
00:30:51,365 --> 00:30:53,285
Go. Be there for her.

545
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,545
Uncle, personal.

546
00:30:55,745 --> 00:30:57,234
-An advice? Come.
-Yes!

547
00:31:00,188 --> 00:31:03,084
Uncle, I've been in love with
a girl for some time now.

548
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,876
The problem is,
she's five years younger than me.

549
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,916
You made a woman 25
years younger than you

550
00:31:08,155 --> 00:31:09,036
fall in love with you.

551
00:31:09,405 --> 00:31:11,686
-Any tips?
-Where does the girl study?

552
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:12,890
Vignan College, Ameerpet.

553
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:13,584
Do one thing.

554
00:31:13,947 --> 00:31:15,750
Open a Xerox shop opposite her college.

555
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,186
You're jobless anyway.

556
00:31:17,386 --> 00:31:19,104
Your career will settle,
and love will bloom.

557
00:31:19,304 --> 00:31:19,938
How is it?

558
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:22,572
I bow to you, Master!

559
00:31:25,294 --> 00:31:27,450
My daughter.
Didn't you ask me to bring her?

560
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,532
-Namaste, Uncle.
-Namaste, dear.

561
00:31:29,732 --> 00:31:33,085
What does the man you
married do for a living?

562
00:31:33,538 --> 00:31:36,343
He runs a pani puri
stall near Lumbini Park.

563
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,984
He started chatting her
up while making chaat.

564
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:42,145
-Then why did you agree to the marriage?
-When did I?

565
00:31:42,345 --> 00:31:44,878
I clearly said they'd get my
approval only over my dead body.

566
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,905
The next day,
she said she was going to a temple.

567
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,401
I let her go.
It was just a temple, after all.

568
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:50,300
That's it.

569
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,551
Half an hour later, they were married.

570
00:31:53,606 --> 00:31:55,856
-Where are you going, Nithya?
-I'm going to the temple, Dad.

571
00:31:56,172 --> 00:31:57,648
-Temp--
-Go on, dear.

572
00:31:57,852 --> 00:31:59,623
Do you need his permission
to visit a temple?

573
00:31:59,871 --> 00:32:01,226
Even she went in the same way.

574
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,081
How long will the divorce take?

575
00:32:05,283 --> 00:32:07,008
-Let's go, now!
-Is he going to the temple?

576
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,441
Do you think your daughter's
getting married in a temple too?

577
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:10,176
Let's go.

578
00:32:10,412 --> 00:32:12,690
-Hey, start the bike.
-We have a car, sir.

579
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,486
We'll get stuck in traffic
if we take the car.

580
00:32:14,737 --> 00:32:15,737
-Start the bike.
-Okay, sir.

581
00:32:15,991 --> 00:32:17,498
-Start it.
-It won't start.

582
00:32:17,698 --> 00:32:18,467
It has a starting trouble.
We need to push it.

583
00:32:18,807 --> 00:32:20,124
[groaning]

584
00:32:20,932 --> 00:32:23,203
-Let's go. Now! Slowly.
-Yes!

585
00:32:25,608 --> 00:32:27,552
Which temple nearby
sees the most weddings?

586
00:32:27,752 --> 00:32:28,965
-I know one, sir.
-Let's go.

587
00:32:29,165 --> 00:32:31,502
You said your daughter was genuine,
look what happened now.

588
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:37,881
We're late, sir. Look there

589
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,120
It's over! It's all over, sir.

590
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,463
-Let's go, sir.
-Nithya!

591
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:43,077
It's over.

592
00:32:44,452 --> 00:32:45,015
Hey.

593
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:48,241
Did you even think about her father?

594
00:32:48,518 --> 00:32:49,814
-Dad, we--
-Shut up!

595
00:32:50,014 --> 00:32:51,353
You failed me as a daughter.

596
00:32:52,872 --> 00:32:53,685
Hey.

597
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,888
People like us don't
expect much from life.

598
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,290
We only wish to marry our daughter off

599
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,679
with our own hands,
amid everyone's blessings.

600
00:33:02,008 --> 00:33:04,625
But you got married without any of that.

601
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:06,437
Marria-- Hey.

602
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,024
Marriage? What are you talking about?

603
00:33:08,243 --> 00:33:11,223
-Sir, put it on.
-What is this?

604
00:33:11,718 --> 00:33:14,148
Everyone's got garlands here.
Maybe it's just a temple custom.

605
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,875
-You overreacted, sir.
-Nithya...

606
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:19,754
You said your father respects you a lot.

607
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:21,318
-He's talking badly about you.
-Dear.

608
00:33:21,343 --> 00:33:22,153
God promise!

609
00:33:22,178 --> 00:33:24,605
I was heading to work and
stopped by the temple.

610
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,589
Office, he says.
Who goes to work in track pants?

611
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:28,871
He's lying. He's following you.

612
00:33:29,189 --> 00:33:31,038
-That's not it, dear. I'm--
-Uncle!

613
00:33:31,238 --> 00:33:32,587
I never thought you'd stoop this low.

614
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:34,492
You prove me wrong every time.

615
00:33:34,692 --> 00:33:35,600
-Please, listen--
-You prove me wrong.

616
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,491
-Nithya, listen to me.
-No, no, Nithya...

617
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:39,252
Is this the father whose
approval you're waiting for?

618
00:33:40,302 --> 00:33:41,139
You passed as a daughter.

619
00:33:41,912 --> 00:33:42,835
He failed as a father.

620
00:33:43,095 --> 00:33:44,676
-He failed. You leave, Nithya.
-Say something, man.

621
00:33:45,152 --> 00:33:47,001
Nithya, Nithya! Dear...

622
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:48,758
-I'm leaving too.
-Hey!

623
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:50,428
What?

624
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,104
Do you want me and my daughter to fight?

625
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:56,043
Uncle, fights are love.

626
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,182
Love always comes with fights.

627
00:33:57,382 --> 00:33:58,770
The love between you
two has only just begun.

628
00:33:59,058 --> 00:34:00,227
If you don't agree for the marriage,

629
00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:00,978
[bell ringing]

630
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,263
it'll only grow stronger.

631
00:34:02,463 --> 00:34:03,547
It's the truth.

632
00:34:03,747 --> 00:34:05,171
-Nithya, Nithya!
-Hey!

633
00:34:05,662 --> 00:34:07,280
You doubted your own daughter, sir.

634
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,894
What is a father? It's trust.

635
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:10,063
And trust is just
another word for father.

636
00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:13,974
-Start the bike.
-Another word, sir...

637
00:34:14,213 --> 00:34:15,289
Go start the bike!

638
00:34:16,163 --> 00:34:17,239
Nithya!

639
00:34:17,565 --> 00:34:19,361
Nithya, dear!

640
00:34:20,234 --> 00:34:22,046
Nithya, listen to me.

641
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:23,920
Nithya!

642
00:34:24,456 --> 00:34:26,660
Nithya, listen to me and open the door.

643
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:29,997
I...

644
00:34:47,122 --> 00:34:48,011
Nithya, dear.

645
00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:50,018
At least have some juice.

646
00:35:02,175 --> 00:35:04,879
Nithya!

647
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:08,106
I agree to your marriage with Gautham.

648
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:09,883
Come out.

649
00:35:12,729 --> 00:35:14,724
Really?

650
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,405
Yes. God promise!

651
00:35:18,807 --> 00:35:19,773
Thank you, dad.

652
00:35:25,267 --> 00:35:26,277
Hi, Uncle.

653
00:35:26,477 --> 00:35:28,175
-What's up, Jackie? Who are they?
-Greetings, sir.

654
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,501
They're the most eligible
bachelors in our area.

655
00:35:30,701 --> 00:35:33,251
They want to settle
down by falling in love.

656
00:35:33,451 --> 00:35:34,650
They've come here for tips.

657
00:35:35,101 --> 00:35:36,948
What am I, Tipu Sultan? To give tips?

658
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:37,968
Don't say that, Uncle.

659
00:35:38,224 --> 00:35:40,986
You look like an uncle to me.
How dare you call me that?

660
00:35:42,284 --> 00:35:44,556
-Who are they?
-They came to your dad for coaching.

661
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,773
Nithya called saying
she's bringing her father.

662
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:47,610
Send them away.

663
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,719
Meeting cancel. Go, leave.

664
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,433
Dad, behave like a matured
adult in front of her father.

665
00:35:52,523 --> 00:35:55,359
What's he saying?
I've been mature for 45 years!

666
00:35:56,024 --> 00:35:58,857
-How I have to mature again?
-He doesn't know the meaning for maturity.

667
00:36:03,876 --> 00:36:04,826
-Hello, Uncle.
-Hello.

668
00:36:05,185 --> 00:36:06,541
-My dad.
-Greetings, sir.

669
00:36:06,812 --> 00:36:08,006
How was your journey?

670
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,902
You call Jubilee Hills to
Banjara Hills a journey?

671
00:36:11,876 --> 00:36:12,909
Is everyone at home doing well?

672
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,097
The maids? Yes, they're doing fine.

673
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,645
They're the only people in the house.
Just answer their questions.

674
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:18,538
She is Nithya.

675
00:36:18,747 --> 00:36:19,859
-Greetings, dear.
-Greetings, Uncle.

676
00:36:20,122 --> 00:36:22,058
God bless you. Bless you with
health, wealth, prosperity, security,

677
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:24,050
-and HITEC City. With maturity...
-Hold on...

678
00:36:24,256 --> 00:36:25,191
Let's go in, Uncle.

679
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:27,941
-Come in. Come.
-He is overdoing it.

680
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:30,528
My mom. She died when I was young.

681
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,381
He's been everything to me since then.

682
00:36:33,581 --> 00:36:35,825
Just because God was unkind to him,
I can't do the same, sir.

683
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:37,806
I did everything I could as a father.

684
00:36:38,006 --> 00:36:39,069
Have a seat, dear.

685
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:41,012
-Pallavi, bring some coffee.-Yeah, coming.

686
00:36:41,213 --> 00:36:42,274
Seems like a decent family, sir.

687
00:36:42,886 --> 00:36:43,775
Sorry.

688
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:45,492
Your daughter?

689
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,039
Daughter? What are you talking about?

690
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,572
-She's my stepmother.
-Step--

691
00:36:51,283 --> 00:36:52,971
Oh, second marriage?

692
00:36:53,265 --> 00:36:54,950
No, sir. Another marriage.

693
00:36:56,267 --> 00:36:57,827
-Please have it, brother.
-Thanks, keep it there, dear.

694
00:36:58,027 --> 00:36:58,508
-Have it.
-Sir.

695
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,885
Doesn't it make you feel young
again when she calls you brother?

696
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:02,484
Sorry, sir.

697
00:37:03,052 --> 00:37:04,082
They had a love marriage too, Dad.

698
00:37:04,282 --> 00:37:06,324
-Oh!
-Gautham helped them.

699
00:37:06,635 --> 00:37:09,513
-Yes.
-Did elders agree to your marriage?

700
00:37:09,745 --> 00:37:12,766
Luckily, there's no elder in my
house older than me to object.

701
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:13,946
Then what about her elders?

702
00:37:14,248 --> 00:37:17,034
Her elders are actually
younger than my dad.

703
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:18,307
That's why we had no issues.

704
00:37:18,742 --> 00:37:21,836
Anyway, in six months, my in-laws
will accept me as their son-in-law.

705
00:37:22,036 --> 00:37:23,762
What will happen in six months?

706
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:26,327
My friend is getting a
little brother or sister.

707
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,438
Unless we have kids, elders don't
agree to a love marriage, sir.

708
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:34,700
You look quite fit.

709
00:37:34,926 --> 00:37:36,545
Why don't you fall in
love and marry again?

710
00:37:36,785 --> 00:37:37,713
What do you say, Uncle?

711
00:37:38,003 --> 00:37:39,738
Should I look for a
beautiful aunty for you?

712
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:41,562
I don't need your advice.

713
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:42,344
Okay.

714
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,213
I'm here to discuss my
daughter's marriage proposal.

715
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:46,632
What's there to discuss?

716
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:47,836
My dad thinks all you need is

717
00:37:48,036 --> 00:37:50,381
an auspicious date,
a marriage hall, and a grand idea.

718
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:51,637
-Right, Dad?
-Of course.

719
00:37:52,048 --> 00:37:54,845
To be honest, I don't like your family.

720
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:57,130
Uncle.

721
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,464
Your habits and your father's mistakes...

722
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:03,042
I don't approve of either.

723
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:05,505
-Dad!
-One minute.

724
00:38:07,211 --> 00:38:09,819
I agreed to this marriage so
my daughter wouldn't suffer.

725
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:12,076
I chose to suffer instead.

726
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:15,432
But,
I have a condition for this marriage.

727
00:38:15,673 --> 00:38:17,092
Just say it.
Your approval is all that matters.

728
00:38:17,298 --> 00:38:21,117
I keep advising people that
love marriages are wrong.

729
00:38:21,317 --> 00:38:26,921
If I accept one myself,
people will look down on me.

730
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:31,227
So I've decided this marriage will
happen at the registrar's office.

731
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,043
Nithya agreed to it too.

732
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,462
-How is that even possible?
-It will.

733
00:38:41,668 --> 00:38:44,288
Marriage is a one-time
experience for anyone.

734
00:38:44,668 --> 00:38:46,460
You shouldn't say that.

735
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:49,137
Of course, I married more than once.

736
00:38:49,565 --> 00:38:51,658
-But that's not the case for everyone.
-Exactly.

737
00:38:51,858 --> 00:38:53,907
-Register marriage--
-We don't want a register marriage.

738
00:38:54,127 --> 00:38:54,894
-Why not?
-It's not right.

739
00:38:55,114 --> 00:38:55,961
-It's not even in our culture.
-Nithya...

740
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:57,859
-How can we, without a nuptial chain?
-Nithya.

741
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:00,880
Tell him you'll agree only
if it's a register marriage.

742
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,160
We want a wedding.

743
00:39:02,452 --> 00:39:05,227
-Who cares where we do it?
-How can we have a register marriage?

744
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:06,752
How can a signature be a marriage?

745
00:39:06,952 --> 00:39:08,843
-That's not a wedding.
-I don't care about all that.

746
00:39:09,274 --> 00:39:12,399
Listen,
Dad agreeing itself is a big thing.

747
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,250
At least let this happen
according to my dad's wishes.

748
00:39:14,523 --> 00:39:15,293
-That's not--
-Please!

749
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:16,863
Listen to me clearly once.

750
00:39:17,235 --> 00:39:17,839
-That--
-Shh!

751
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:20,884
-Let's go.
-You know their family is very disciplined.

752
00:39:21,084 --> 00:39:21,884
-Dad, Gautham agreed.
-Wow...

753
00:39:22,475 --> 00:39:23,262
-Good.
-Hey.

754
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:25,468
Let's just get this over with.

755
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,710
Apart from your family and mine,

756
00:39:27,952 --> 00:39:29,736
no one else should attend the wedding.
Okay?

757
00:39:31,477 --> 00:39:33,340
-Okay, brother-in-law.
-Good.

758
00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:36,360
By the way, what was your name again?

759
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:37,423
-Karthik.
-Huh?

760
00:39:38,277 --> 00:39:39,924
You heard it right. It's Karthik.

761
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,952
-And you are?
-Ramalingaiah.

762
00:39:43,825 --> 00:39:44,454
Oh.

763
00:39:45,178 --> 00:39:47,469
Your father should've
thought more modern.

764
00:39:47,669 --> 00:39:49,227
-What?
-It's nothing, brother-in-law.

765
00:39:50,634 --> 00:39:51,832
Rishi, Roshan.

766
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:54,374
I feel sad for him.

767
00:39:56,803 --> 00:39:58,970
This is our team and guys,
this is Gautham.

768
00:39:59,236 --> 00:39:59,848
-Hi.
-Hi.

769
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:01,791
-Yeah. Nice to meet you.
-Gautham, this is your desk.

770
00:40:03,379 --> 00:40:05,339
Hey, they even wrote Gautham on it.

771
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,971
Where is the team lead?

772
00:40:07,997 --> 00:40:09,736
Actually, the team lead resigned.

773
00:40:10,063 --> 00:40:12,197
But I guess,
we'll have a new team lead next week.

774
00:40:12,398 --> 00:40:13,221
Okay, nice.

775
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,640
-You carry on. Good luck.
-Okay.

776
00:40:15,158 --> 00:40:17,102
-Bye.
-Naughty.

777
00:40:19,435 --> 00:40:20,277
I wonder who my colleague is.

778
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:26,843
Sir.

779
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,530
Oh, by the way, a new joinee?

780
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:35,630
You're looking good, bro.

781
00:40:36,098 --> 00:40:37,712
By the way, I'm Raj, Appalraj.

782
00:40:38,054 --> 00:40:39,378
Whatever. Delete that picture.

783
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:41,665
Why, bro?

784
00:40:42,665 --> 00:40:43,835
She's my crush, bro.

785
00:40:45,182 --> 00:40:46,540
She's my fiance, bro.

786
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:48,410
Oh! Not your wife yet.

787
00:40:51,336 --> 00:40:52,290
She will be, in a month, bro.

788
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:53,754
Oh!

789
00:40:54,028 --> 00:40:56,232
There's still one month,
right. I'll keep trying.

790
00:40:57,697 --> 00:40:58,332
Yeah.

791
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,210
You think you're Victory Venkatesh?

792
00:41:01,482 --> 00:41:03,965
To call off a wedding a month before?

793
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:04,855
No, bro.

794
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,001
Allu Arjun from the Arya movie.

795
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,315
Naughty boy.

796
00:41:09,682 --> 00:41:11,246
If you don't delete it,
I'll cut you into pieces.

797
00:41:11,446 --> 00:41:12,215
Do you understand?

798
00:41:12,713 --> 00:41:13,614
I'll delete it, bro.

799
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:16,602
-Gautham, right?
-Yes.

800
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:17,817
I'll see your end.

801
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,000
Yeah, right. Delete it first.

802
00:41:23,137 --> 00:41:26,072
Where is a tattoo shop nearby? Found it.

803
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,427
Yes!

804
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,214
Good afternoon, sir. Care for a tattoo?

805
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,154
Not a new one.
I'm here to remove the old one.

806
00:41:37,449 --> 00:41:38,660
Please wait for five minutes.

807
00:41:45,073 --> 00:41:46,073
Does it hurt, sir?

808
00:41:47,073 --> 00:41:49,032
Pain is fine in love and war.

809
00:41:51,407 --> 00:41:52,881
-"If Pallavi is Karthik's life"
-It's done, sir.

810
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,231
-Yes?
-Is it done?

811
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,987
It is done.

812
00:41:55,187 --> 00:41:56,919
-Another customer's waiting.
-I'll be there.

813
00:41:57,198 --> 00:41:59,115
"Isn't it also the other way around?"

814
00:42:00,002 --> 00:42:03,358
[singing random song]

815
00:42:05,198 --> 00:42:06,395
Hey, what are you doing here?

816
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:07,650
And why are you here?

817
00:42:08,332 --> 00:42:10,036
Since our marriage
anniversary is nearing,

818
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:14,277
I tattooed her name on
my chest to surprise her.

819
00:42:15,945 --> 00:42:16,987
Why are you here?

820
00:42:17,232 --> 00:42:20,053
That... I'm also here for a tattoo.

821
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:23,227
-Nice!
-Tattoo removal costs 5,000 bucks.

822
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:25,338
Get lost! Worst timing ever.

823
00:42:25,538 --> 00:42:26,771
-Tattoo removal?
-No!

824
00:42:26,983 --> 00:42:28,810
-Whose name are you erasing?
-It's not that, Dad.

825
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,052
-It's not like that, Dad.
-Show me.

826
00:42:30,277 --> 00:42:30,912
-Dad, dad, dad. It's nothing.
-Wait. Show me!

827
00:42:31,112 --> 00:42:32,213
-Hey, hey.
-Dad, dad.

828
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:34,844
Dia?

829
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,135
Hey.

830
00:42:36,427 --> 00:42:39,830
I thought you were shy, since you never
walked around the house without a shirt.

831
00:42:40,064 --> 00:42:42,504
Hey, who is this Dia?
Just tell me, who is she?

832
00:42:42,797 --> 00:42:43,883
She was my lover
during my college days.

833
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,050
Another love?

834
00:42:58,365 --> 00:42:59,132
I think we should...

835
00:42:59,738 --> 00:43:01,457
Sir, I need to talk to
you about something.

836
00:43:01,804 --> 00:43:03,824
I'm in the middle of an important
discussion. Come back later.

837
00:43:04,073 --> 00:43:05,448
We also have something
important to discuss.

838
00:43:05,869 --> 00:43:08,124
The college washroom is terrible. How long
has it been since we asked for a new one?

839
00:43:08,788 --> 00:43:09,747
You don't care at all.

840
00:43:10,012 --> 00:43:11,221
Do you think this is a private college?

841
00:43:11,571 --> 00:43:14,321
Or do you pay lakhs in
fees to make such demands?

842
00:43:14,937 --> 00:43:17,437
I'll fix it when the government
funds are sanctioned. Leave.

843
00:43:17,707 --> 00:43:18,873
So where do we go to pee till then?

844
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,000
That's your issue. Handle it yourself.

845
00:43:21,353 --> 00:43:22,728
He's right, sir.

846
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,976
This is our problem.
We'll handle it.

847
00:43:26,703 --> 00:43:28,274
Hey, hey!

848
00:43:28,862 --> 00:43:30,534
-Hey, where are you going?
-He'd be back.

849
00:43:33,262 --> 00:43:33,875
Oh wow!

850
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,735
Even without any funding,
Sir's washroom is amazing.

851
00:43:35,888 --> 00:43:36,548
Is that so!

852
00:43:36,921 --> 00:43:39,265
We'll use Sir's washroom
until the new one is constructed.

853
00:43:39,746 --> 00:43:41,428
-Inform all the students.
-Problem solved, man!

854
00:43:41,825 --> 00:43:42,607
Hey!

855
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,242
We're students, Sir.

856
00:43:58,301 --> 00:44:00,840
We scribble more on the
washroom walls than we do in exams.

857
00:44:01,728 --> 00:44:03,378
Going forward, we'll
even write curse words.

858
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:04,671
You won't be able to bear it.

859
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:06,976
Get the washroom built fast.

860
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,847
[teeth grinding in anger]

861
00:44:11,912 --> 00:44:13,633
That's how we made the
principal's office our own washroom.

862
00:44:14,249 --> 00:44:15,166
Since they never built one,

863
00:44:15,266 --> 00:44:16,146
-we pooled our funds...
-Hey, stop!

864
00:44:16,472 --> 00:44:19,413
I'm talking about Dia, and you're
narrating Sulabh complex tales.

865
00:44:19,572 --> 00:44:20,447
There's a connection, Dad.

866
00:44:20,862 --> 00:44:22,885
Dia is none other than
my principal's daughter.

867
00:44:50,294 --> 00:44:51,604
What happened today, Dad?

868
00:44:51,821 --> 00:44:54,487
Gautham turned my office room
into a Sulabh Complex, dear.

869
00:44:54,851 --> 00:44:57,319
How can they use my washroom
just because theirs isn't good?

870
00:44:57,524 --> 00:44:59,565
Will they move in here too
if the hostel loses electricity?

871
00:44:59,826 --> 00:45:02,051
-That...
-Who is this Gautham? Which department?

872
00:45:02,518 --> 00:45:03,489
Show him to me, Dad.

873
00:45:03,733 --> 00:45:05,252
-I'll give him a strong warning.
-Don't, dear.

874
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,728
We must stay far away from
dustbins and septic tanks.

875
00:45:07,983 --> 00:45:09,113
He belongs to the latter.

876
00:45:11,999 --> 00:45:14,588
Ugh! Gautham, leave.
Dad will be here soon.

877
00:45:15,218 --> 00:45:18,920
He's such a fool! With his frustration,
he won't be back for half an hour.

878
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:23,011
Stop disrespecting him.

879
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,827
How many times
do I have to tell you?

880
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:26,634
Don't pick fights with my dad.

881
00:45:26,871 --> 00:45:28,940
If he's correct, why
would I argue with him?

882
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,943
What if he opposes our marriage
because of all these issues?

883
00:45:32,381 --> 00:45:33,690
I'll leave you. Break up!

884
00:45:33,927 --> 00:45:35,076
-You'll leave me?
-Hmm!

885
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:36,989
-You'll leave me?
-Yeah!

886
00:45:37,122 --> 00:45:38,368
You'll leave me?

887
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:40,121
Ah! I've been wanting to say this.

888
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:41,314
What is this?

889
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:48,001
I watched a Tamil movie recently.

890
00:45:48,463 --> 00:45:50,074
To impress the heroine, the hero...

891
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:52,005
gets her name tattooed.

892
00:45:52,676 --> 00:45:56,892
Don't apply movie logic to real life,
please.

893
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,588
Oh, speaking of movies...

894
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:02,561
-I watched an English film yesterday...-Dia.

895
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:04,547
He's here again.

896
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:05,635
Dia, dear.

897
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:08,152
-I hear voices.
-Voices?

898
00:46:08,286 --> 00:46:10,552
-Are you on phone?
-I'm not talking, though.

899
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:12,789
-You didn't?
-What is it, Dad?

900
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,693
[bike engine sound]

901
00:46:16,053 --> 00:46:16,713
What?

902
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:19,217
-What is Gautham doing here?
-Gautham?

903
00:46:19,628 --> 00:46:20,644
Which Gautham?

904
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,170
-Dad.
-Hmm!

905
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,324
You seem deeply
disturbed by him.

906
00:46:24,614 --> 00:46:27,174
That's why you're imagining
him. There's no one there.

907
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,854
-Come.
-Wait a moment.

908
00:46:30,376 --> 00:46:32,613
I don't know. Maybe it's all the stress.

909
00:46:32,946 --> 00:46:34,032
Have some rest, Dad.

910
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:38,395
If you irritate her dad this much,
how did she even fall for you?

911
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:39,210
Is that really necessary?

912
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:40,876
-Why did stepmom love you?
-That...

913
00:46:41,905 --> 00:46:42,661
Forget it. Go on.

914
00:46:42,959 --> 00:46:47,393
I didn't believe the reviewers when
they said films impact real life.

915
00:46:48,491 --> 00:46:51,848

One day, her father saw us together.

00:50:05,475 --> 00:50:08,919
He wasn't hurt by our love. He was
broken by the fact that I loved her.

949
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,891
He put her under house
arrest for four days.

950
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:14,043
No calls or messages. I was turning mad.

951
00:50:15,615 --> 00:50:17,780
She called me after a week.

952
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:25,298
Gautham... my father found out about us.

00:50:26,917 --> 00:50:28,877
Don't worry.
I'll take care of everything.

What happened?

955
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,784
It's nothing, man.
Her dad found out about us.

956
00:50:39,992 --> 00:50:41,492
We've got to figure something out, dude.

Yes!

961
00:50:57,158 --> 00:50:59,660
Does a couple of signatures
really make it a marriage?

962
00:51:00,033 --> 00:51:02,498
Wait, Gautham.
Do you think marriage is that easy?

963
00:51:03,055 --> 00:51:04,533
It's not a wedding, dear.

964
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,304
It's protection in case your father
tries to marry you off tomorrow.

965
00:51:07,584 --> 00:51:11,264
What is marriage? It's the sacred thread,

We'll do all of that once we're settled.

Tell me, dear.

995
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:23,442
Are you entering this marriage
of your own free will?

996
00:52:26,654 --> 00:52:27,450
Tell him.

We've been in love for four years.

1002

But we have never once quarreled.

1003
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,043
Isn't that reason enough, sir

1004
00:52:50,913 --> 00:52:53,754
to believe that life with
him will be truly happy.

1005
00:52:58,026 --> 00:52:59,108
Can I ask you just one more thing, dear?

1006
00:52:59,308 --> 00:53:00,773
What, do you want her father's number?
We're not giving it.

1007

First, tell us where we need to sign.

00:53:02,955 --> 00:53:05,009
-Sign right there in the register.
-Oh! Here?

1009
00:53:05,372 --> 00:53:07,339
You should have said that earlier!
Do you want to sign first?

1010
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,580
Shall I?

1011
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,372
-Next!
-Mr. Register!

1012
00:53:22,497 --> 00:53:23,788
Mark my words.

1013
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,580
Potlakayila Gautham.

1014
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:32,687
There may be 'vegetables' in my family
name, but we'll treat her like a queen.

1015
00:53:33,413 --> 00:53:35,247
I don't wish to meet you ever again.

1016
00:53:35,538 --> 00:53:37,036
If our paths cross again,

1017
00:53:39,705 --> 00:53:43,369
I'll make sure you call us the
best couple of the decade yourself.

1018
00:53:45,152 --> 00:53:46,538
Good bye!

1019
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:49,669
You said she was your lover.
Did you marry her too?

1020
00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:51,507
It just happened, Dad.

1021
00:53:51,707 --> 00:53:54,658
-What happened next?
-We broke up and moved on.

1022
00:53:54,858 --> 00:53:55,916
I don't even know where she is now.

1023
00:53:56,116 --> 00:53:58,014
She is living her life and I... mine.

1024
00:53:58,214 --> 00:54:00,646
Look, if Nithya finds out about this,

1025
00:54:00,846 --> 00:54:03,581
she'll drag you both onto that
'Batuku Jataka Bandi' show!

1026
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:05,672
I raised you like a King.

1027
00:54:06,005 --> 00:54:07,630
Never expected to see
you facing Roja on TV.

1028
00:54:07,672 --> 00:54:09,121
Dad, stop giving me unnecessary tension.

1029
00:54:09,471 --> 00:54:10,683
If I remove this tattoo,
it'll be gone, right?

1030
00:54:10,883 --> 00:54:11,689
How would they find out?

1031
00:54:11,963 --> 00:54:13,005
-Remove it.
-Get rid of it.

1032
00:54:14,152 --> 00:54:15,923
Sir, this is a permanent tattoo!
Can't remove it.

1033
00:54:17,232 --> 00:54:17,994
Look.

1034
00:54:18,445 --> 00:54:20,662
Just pour some phenyl or
kerosene and scrub it off, man!

1035
00:54:20,897 --> 00:54:22,943
Sir, this is not a dry cleaning.
It's a tattoo shop.

1036
00:54:25,538 --> 00:54:27,067
Look, just figure something out.

1037
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:27,834
Try it.

1038
00:54:28,651 --> 00:54:31,813
-Yes, Sruthi, I'll be right there, baby.
-Even he has a girlfriend.

1039
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:33,443
-Yes, Nithya.-Where are you, Gautham?

1040
00:54:33,468 --> 00:54:34,505
Tattoo...

1041
00:54:35,823 --> 00:54:38,962
Yes. I'm having lunch at Tattoo
Teetee Chinese restaurant.

1042
00:54:39,163 --> 00:54:40,902
We thought of visiting
the registrar's office.

1043
00:54:41,102 --> 00:54:42,510
Send me your location
and I'll pick you up.

1044
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:43,989
No. No. I'll come to office.

1045
00:54:44,189 --> 00:54:45,200
-Okay.
-Bye, Dad.

1046
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,490
What's wrong? You look a bit off.

1047
00:54:57,842 --> 00:54:58,621
Is everything okay?

1048
00:54:59,281 --> 00:55:00,165
Yes. It's okay.

1049
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:02,884
You seem to be under
some kind of tension.

1050
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,265
What? Tension? No way. I'm happy.

1051
00:55:08,273 --> 00:55:11,754
Well anyway,
which registrar office are we going?

1052
00:55:12,116 --> 00:55:13,780
-Madhapur.
-Madhapur?!

1053
00:55:15,161 --> 00:55:15,780
I mean...

1054
00:55:16,492 --> 00:55:19,886
Vanasthalipuram is a nice drive.
We can enjoy the trip.

1055
00:55:20,175 --> 00:55:21,268
Are you mad?

1056
00:55:21,717 --> 00:55:22,825
Why go that far?

1057
00:55:23,025 --> 00:55:27,029
I mean, they say if we get married in
Vanasthalipuram, everyone will be happy.

1058
00:55:27,229 --> 00:55:27,748
That's why.

1059
00:55:28,209 --> 00:55:29,864
Wherever we get married, we'll be happy.

1060
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:31,375
Okay?

1061
00:55:31,792 --> 00:55:32,795
Oh my!

1062
00:55:32,995 --> 00:55:35,321
Please sign here and
tell her to sign here.

1063
00:55:35,521 --> 00:55:36,294
-And take this to...
-Excuse me...

1064
00:55:36,494 --> 00:55:37,443
Give me a marriage application.

1065
00:55:41,395 --> 00:55:42,310
Its done, come on.

1066
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:45,747
How did you fill it so soon?

1067
00:55:47,656 --> 00:55:49,150
I came here for my friends marriage.

1068
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:51,724
Its experience, I will help you come.

1069
00:55:51,924 --> 00:55:52,736
Come on.

1070
00:56:00,217 --> 00:56:02,007
Oh no! He hasn’t retired yet?

1071
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:13,929
-What's your name, girl?
-Nithya, sir.

1072
00:56:14,177 --> 00:56:15,368
-Surname?
-Vedula.

1073
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:17,915
-What's your name, boy?
-Gautham.

1074
00:56:18,263 --> 00:56:21,009
-Surname?
-Potlakayila.

1075
00:56:30,477 --> 00:56:31,853
You've been here before, haven't you?

1076
00:56:31,878 --> 00:56:33,693
-No, this is my first time here.
-He was here, sir.

1077
00:56:33,718 --> 00:56:34,605
That's what I say!

1078
00:56:34,805 --> 00:56:37,434
He just came here to be a
witness at a friend's wedding.

1079
00:56:38,118 --> 00:56:40,982
Witness at a friend's
wedding. I forgot, sir.

1080
00:56:41,182 --> 00:56:43,206
Sir, when will we know the date?

1081
00:56:43,461 --> 00:56:45,309
You've given your number, right?
We will call you.

1082
00:56:45,509 --> 00:56:47,029
-You can leave now.
-Okay, sir.

1083
00:56:47,229 --> 00:56:48,170
Come. It's getting late.

1084
00:56:49,176 --> 00:56:50,699
He came to his friends marriage?

1085
00:56:53,948 --> 00:56:56,942
Here, take this money for your
Xerox shop. Settle down in life.

1086
00:56:57,142 --> 00:56:57,864
Thank you, uncle.

1087
00:56:58,395 --> 00:56:59,796
-Uncle, I have a doubt.
-What is it?

1088
00:57:00,186 --> 00:57:02,270
Until now,
I haven't actually seen you do any work.

1089
00:57:02,495 --> 00:57:04,760
How did you earn all this
money and property, uncle?

1090
00:57:04,978 --> 00:57:06,046
Did my father leave any properties or...

1091
00:57:06,246 --> 00:57:08,324
Apart from my father's ashes,
I have nothing.

1092
00:57:08,524 --> 00:57:09,815
But... did you invest in
any shares or something?

1093
00:57:10,015 --> 00:57:11,501
I am the lion! Why would I need shares?

1094
00:57:12,383 --> 00:57:13,703
Okay, did you buy any Bitcoins?

1095
00:57:13,903 --> 00:57:15,946
I've only ever dealt with 'bits'.
I have nothing to do with Bitcoins!

1096
00:57:16,146 --> 00:57:17,965
Then, how did you earn all
this wealth and property?

1097
00:57:19,149 --> 00:57:21,760
Come...
He is the reason behind all of this.

1098
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,678
Who, Uncle? One of your forefathers?

1099
00:57:24,879 --> 00:57:27,048
No! King of Bhutan!

1100
00:57:27,497 --> 00:57:29,611
He introduced the Bhutan lottery.

1101
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:32,266
Ever since I was a kid, I've had
a habit of buying lottery tickets.

1102
00:57:32,479 --> 00:57:33,629
But I never won anything.

1103
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:36,384
Once, I prayed to his
portrait and bought a ticket.

1104
00:57:36,584 --> 00:57:37,836
Just like that... I won thirty crores!

1105
00:57:38,313 --> 00:57:41,533
But the government took a thirty
percent cut! It was so unfair.

1106
00:57:41,896 --> 00:57:43,981
You did zero work and still
pocketed seventy percent!

1107
00:57:44,224 --> 00:57:45,272
That's not exactly what I'd call unfair.

1108
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,192
Ironically,
the very land that gave you this wealth

1109
00:57:47,392 --> 00:57:49,506
remains impoverished. Poor Bhutan.

1110
00:57:49,889 --> 00:57:52,230
I'm doing my bit for the country.

1111
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,114
A yearly donation of 1,116
rupees to the PM Relief Fund.

1112
00:57:55,324 --> 00:57:57,682
You hit a jackpot and
are donating titbits.

1113
00:57:57,882 --> 00:57:59,730
-That's how it works.
-Dad!

1114
00:58:00,447 --> 00:58:01,056
-Good news.
-What is it?

1115
00:58:01,256 --> 00:58:02,715
The registrar didn't recognize us.

1116
00:58:02,915 --> 00:58:04,058
Our family is safe.

1117
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,665
-Super, dude!
-Super!

1118
00:58:09,931 --> 00:58:10,691
-Hello.
-He is my son.

1119
00:58:10,891 --> 00:58:13,457
Sir, it seems, your Aadhaar card copy
is missing. Sir wants to see you.

1120
00:58:13,856 --> 00:58:15,318
Get it and come to the
Registrar's office immediately.

1121
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:17,648
Missing it again? This is total chaos!

1122
00:58:19,103 --> 00:58:21,083
You asked for the Aadhaar copy?
Here you go.

1123
00:58:21,478 --> 00:58:23,606
When do you think our wedding will be?

1124
00:58:23,806 --> 00:58:25,272
You're getting a call. Go.

1125
00:58:25,603 --> 00:58:26,797
Okay. Thank you.

1126
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:29,675
-Thank God.
-So... did you break up with that girl?

1127
00:58:32,274 --> 00:58:34,100
Best couple of the decade!

1128
00:58:34,425 --> 00:58:37,326
-Oh no! He remembered me.
-Did you think I'd forget?

1129
00:58:37,526 --> 00:58:38,709
Mr. Potlakayila Gautham?

1130
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:44,997
Had you signed in silence
and left, I'd have let it go.

1131
00:58:46,736 --> 00:58:48,783
You told me to remember
it you before you left.

1132
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:49,822
Sir, sir, sir.

1133
00:58:50,022 --> 00:58:53,099
I was young and reckless back then and
made a mistake without knowing any better.

1134
00:58:53,299 --> 00:58:54,748
If you could find it in
your heart to cooperate,

1135
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,121
I will correct my mistake.
I will set my life right.

1136
00:58:57,406 --> 00:58:59,962
-Aren't you a major?
-Stop it, sir. What major?

1137
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:01,638
Did I go to war or fight battles?

1138
00:59:01,881 --> 00:59:03,721
I messed up, sir. Forgive me.

1139
00:59:06,148 --> 00:59:08,447
Now, my ego is satisfied.

1140
00:59:09,615 --> 00:59:11,909
Did you tell this girl about that girl?

1141
00:59:11,934 --> 00:59:13,882
Come on, sir! Is that really
something worth mentioning?

1142
00:59:13,907 --> 00:59:16,458
So, you're marrying this girl
without telling her the truth?

1143
00:59:17,143 --> 00:59:17,957
Yes, sir.

1144
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:19,815
I won't tell her either.

1145
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,909
Thank you, sir.

1146
00:59:20,934 --> 00:59:22,714
Go and get the divorce certificate.

1147
00:59:23,717 --> 00:59:25,862
Divorce?!
What are you talking about, sir?

1148
00:59:25,887 --> 00:59:26,959
You two are separated, right?

1149
00:59:26,984 --> 00:59:28,296
We had a breakup and moved on, sir.

1150
00:59:28,321 --> 00:59:31,366
To break up and part ways,
you two weren't just lovers.

1151
00:59:31,391 --> 00:59:32,500
Wife and husband.

1152
00:59:32,525 --> 00:59:34,517
To proceed with this marriage,

1153
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:38,717
bring me your Aadhaar, Caste
certificate, and your divorce papers.

1154
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:40,500
I have no idea where she even lives, sir.

1155
00:59:40,721 --> 00:59:41,971
If she shows up tomorrow

1156
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,362
and asks why I married off a man who's
already hitched, and files a case

1157
00:59:45,634 --> 00:59:47,137
they'll throw both of us in jail!

1158
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:48,179
Shall we go?

1159
00:59:48,676 --> 00:59:50,396
Go and get the certificate.

1160
00:59:54,233 --> 00:59:55,067
Sir...

1161
00:59:56,528 --> 00:59:59,307
Can't you just take some
cash and look the other way?

1162
01:00:01,339 --> 01:00:04,139
Bring the divorce certificate.
The marriage will happen.

1163
01:00:06,422 --> 01:00:07,381
Go!

1164
01:00:09,714 --> 01:00:10,952
So, what's the name of this girl?

1165
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:14,032
-Nithya.
-Oh!

1166
01:00:15,222 --> 01:00:17,453
So, you're a daily bridegroom!

1167
01:00:19,781 --> 01:00:20,739
Go.

1168
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:24,357
-Keep the files are ready by the morning.
-OK, sir.

1169
01:00:24,464 --> 01:00:27,158
Dear, have you applied at
the Registrar's office?

1170
01:00:27,183 --> 01:00:30,017
We did, Dad. They will intimate
the wedding date in a week.

1171
01:00:30,042 --> 01:00:31,809
Very good. So are you happy?

1172
01:00:31,834 --> 01:00:34,300
-Very happy. Thank you so much.
-OK, dear.

1173
01:00:34,325 --> 01:00:36,705
-Love you.
-Love you! Go inside.

1174
01:00:37,972 --> 01:00:40,302
Sir, you're really a great father.

1175
01:00:40,631 --> 01:00:43,669
You accepted your daughter's love and
gave a green signal to their wedding.

1176
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:48,435
How could you think that I would allow my
daughter become a member of that family?

1177
01:00:48,666 --> 01:00:50,769
Sir, what do you mean?

1178
01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:54,370
Before my daughter signs at
the Registrar's office...

1179
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,396
If he makes even a single
mistake and gets caught,

1180
01:00:58,596 --> 01:01:00,146
I will stop their wedding immediately.

1181
01:01:00,346 --> 01:01:02,186
Sir, what if he doesn't make that mistake?

1182
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:08,123
Is he a God to not falter?

1183
01:01:09,474 --> 01:01:11,867
He is the son of Karthik who
married twice shamelessly.

1184
01:01:15,067 --> 01:01:18,372
Dude, there are three Facebook
profiles with the name Dia Kakarla!

1185
01:01:19,173 --> 01:01:20,645
But... one has Kajal's photo,

1186
01:01:20,902 --> 01:01:23,959
one has Samantha's, and the third
one has a photo of Sai Pallavi!

1187
01:01:24,676 --> 01:01:25,835
Who could it be?

1188
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,299
I don't think it's any of them, dude.

1189
01:01:27,324 --> 01:01:29,575
Only the ones who lack confidence in
their looks hide behind celebrity photos.

1190
01:01:29,939 --> 01:01:33,102
-How do you know?
-I kept Mahesh Babu's photo as my DP!

1191
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:35,714
Just to be safe,
message that Sai Pallavi profile first.

1192
01:01:36,398 --> 01:01:37,559
She's a big Sai Pallavi fan.

1193
01:01:38,439 --> 01:01:40,455
500 rupees for a photo,
and 10,000 rupees for a video.

1194
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,415
Dude, she's asking for 10000
rupees for a video call.

1195
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,221
Call her!

1196
01:01:44,246 --> 01:01:46,993
-Show me.
-Here.

1197
01:01:48,189 --> 01:01:50,443
-Wow!
-This is a different matter.

1198
01:01:50,468 --> 01:01:51,385
I didn't thought it was...

1199
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:53,039
The wedding just happened,
and he's already saying 'wow'!

1200
01:01:53,064 --> 01:01:55,080
-She's pregnant, right? So...
-Won't you ever change?

1201
01:01:55,189 --> 01:01:56,479
Check...

1202
01:01:58,323 --> 01:02:00,147
Dad, did you search?

1203
01:02:00,172 --> 01:02:01,956
Yes, this one.

1204
01:02:01,981 --> 01:02:03,873
It says 'Dad's little princess'.

1205
01:02:03,898 --> 01:02:05,722
Yes! It definitely has to be her.

1206
01:02:05,754 --> 01:02:09,040
Hi Dia. Where are you?
How are you? It's me, Gautham.

1207
01:02:09,222 --> 01:02:10,308
What is she saying?

1208
01:02:18,614 --> 01:02:20,618
Dude, she's just a school-going kid!

1209
01:02:20,643 --> 01:02:21,775
Sri Chaitanya biotech!

1210
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,713
Nibbi account!

1211
01:02:25,093 --> 01:02:27,755
I misread the bio, man.

1212
01:02:28,526 --> 01:02:29,972
-Karthik!
-Chinnu?

1213
01:02:33,689 --> 01:02:34,992
Today is Vaikunta Ekadashi.

1214
01:02:35,192 --> 01:02:36,390
We should go to the temple.
Go and get ready.

1215
01:02:41,926 --> 01:02:44,385
It's Ekadashi!
But they are roaming around hand-in-hand!

1216
01:02:44,968 --> 01:02:47,412
Get lost. I'm literally
dying here all by myself.

1217
01:02:48,126 --> 01:02:49,126
Go, sir.

1218
01:02:49,534 --> 01:02:52,336
Dude, I found Rashmi Mundaka's profile.
Look what's in here...

1219
01:02:52,743 --> 01:02:53,930
Gautham, you too.

1220
01:02:55,284 --> 01:02:56,326
Let's go, you idiot!

1221
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:06,196
This Vaikunta Ekadashi is very important.

1222
01:03:06,551 --> 01:03:08,040
Uncle, your daughter is calling for you!

1223
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,576
Hey girl! That's my wife!

1224
01:03:09,802 --> 01:03:11,713
She looks like your daughter
to everyone else, except you!

1225
01:03:12,051 --> 01:03:15,097
The Registrar is refusing to marry
us until he sees the divorce papers.

1226
01:03:15,297 --> 01:03:18,007
Is this the only registry office in town?

1227
01:03:18,207 --> 01:03:19,621
Let's marry at a
different registrar office.

1228
01:03:19,822 --> 01:03:24,347
Should we do something like that, he said
he'll spill everything to his father-in-law.

1229
01:03:26,028 --> 01:03:28,851
-Why did he take it so personally?
-Of course he would.

1230
01:03:29,117 --> 01:03:32,254
What your son did at Dia's
wedding was no small thing.

1231
01:03:32,754 --> 01:03:35,646
He blabbered like a newly elected MLA

1232
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:37,402
at a press meet. On top of that,

1233
01:03:37,608 --> 01:03:39,468
he went and called them the
best couple of the decade'.

1234
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,133
Innocence.

1235
01:03:47,673 --> 01:03:48,673
Short-tempered!

1236
01:03:49,632 --> 01:03:52,590
-Alright! I'm a loose talker.
-Caught you, first time.

1237
01:03:52,923 --> 01:03:55,965
Hey! This temple is so powerful.
Do three rounds,

1238
01:03:56,423 --> 01:03:58,913
-and all your wedding hurdles will vanish.
-Alright, I'll see.

1239
01:04:45,503 --> 01:04:46,758
Dia, how're you here?

1240
01:04:46,783 --> 01:04:48,936
-I was just praying--
-Who are you?

1241
01:04:48,961 --> 01:04:50,003
Me?

1242
01:04:51,211 --> 01:04:52,801
It's fine to be mad at me.

1243
01:04:53,433 --> 01:04:55,715
But I need to talk to you.

1244
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,746
Aren't you even going to ask what it is?

1245
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:03,352
Though it may seem unnecessary,
it's necessary I tell you.

1246
01:05:04,441 --> 01:05:07,716
We got married way too young.

1247
01:05:07,916 --> 01:05:09,592
This marriage is holding me back.

1248
01:05:11,192 --> 01:05:12,978
My life's in your hands now, Dia.

1249
01:05:13,178 --> 01:05:14,565
If you grant the divorce,

1250
01:05:14,976 --> 01:05:17,277
neither of us will be troubled.

1251
01:05:17,551 --> 01:05:18,652
Uncle, have some prasadam.

1252
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:25,851
Uncle... that's Dia.

1253
01:05:27,529 --> 01:05:29,508
-She looks great!
-So what?

1254
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:31,240
-Should I marry them both?
-Stop the nonsense.

1255
01:05:31,515 --> 01:05:33,685
-Not everyone's like you.
-It's not that, son.

1256
01:05:36,481 --> 01:05:37,176
Hey!

1257
01:05:37,843 --> 01:05:40,719
-Did he put a toe ring on the girl?
-No, uncle.

1258
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:45,665
-Did he tie the wedding knot?
-Ugh! No, uncle.

1259
01:05:45,856 --> 01:05:48,286
Why are you bothering me?
I'm stressed already.

1260
01:05:48,551 --> 01:05:50,077
If he hasn't tied the knot...

1261
01:05:50,301 --> 01:05:51,828
If you grant the divorce,

1262
01:05:52,028 --> 01:05:55,224
neither of us... will be troubled.

1263
01:05:55,424 --> 01:05:55,909
Hey!

1264
01:05:56,132 --> 01:05:57,625
-Wait, Dad! I am talking to her, right?
-Look down.

1265
01:05:57,884 --> 01:05:59,195
What's your problem, Dad?

1266
01:05:59,468 --> 01:06:01,725
-She has toe rings on her feet.
-So what?

1267
01:06:01,948 --> 01:06:03,805
-You go on, Dia.
-She's married, son!

1268
01:06:19,843 --> 01:06:20,800
Dear!

1269
01:06:21,593 --> 01:06:22,718
Done with darshan.

1270
01:06:23,343 --> 01:06:25,634
I'm handing out prasadam to the beggars.

1271
01:06:26,484 --> 01:06:27,492
Beggars?

1272
01:06:30,161 --> 01:06:31,051
She just called us beggars, son.

1273
01:06:34,459 --> 01:06:35,830
Hey! What about my divorce?

1274
01:06:39,322 --> 01:06:41,039
Gautham! Where are you?

1275
01:06:41,723 --> 01:06:43,846
Looks like some documents
are missing at the registrar.

1276
01:06:44,126 --> 01:06:46,648
They won't give us a date
without those papers.

1277
01:06:46,848 --> 01:06:47,935
Submit them soon.

1278
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,200
I'm on it.

1279
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,980
How could she get married, dude?
Didn't I cross her mind?

1280
01:07:11,315 --> 01:07:14,732
You are getting married too.
Did you think of her?

1281
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:17,690
I mean,
it would've helped if you got her number.

1282
01:07:18,815 --> 01:07:20,607
She's married and happy now, dude.

1283
01:07:21,023 --> 01:07:23,065
Why trouble her for a divorce again?

1284
01:07:23,090 --> 01:07:26,590
But the registrar won't allow it. He says
the divorce certificate's compulsory.

1285
01:07:28,857 --> 01:07:29,774
Yeah, correct, man.

1286
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:32,041
What if I don't get a
registered marriage?

1287
01:07:33,032 --> 01:07:34,324
What if I marry outside? Like she did?

1288
01:07:34,349 --> 01:07:36,032
No certificate needed then, dude.

1289
01:07:36,057 --> 01:07:37,699
-Dad!
-Super, dude.

1290
01:07:39,943 --> 01:07:42,931
-Hello!
-Hello, brother-in-law! Karthik here.

1291
01:07:44,683 --> 01:07:46,642
It's you? What is it?

1292
01:07:46,667 --> 01:07:47,535
Nothing, brother-in-law!

1293
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,134
We've a small celebration at our home,
brother-in-law.

1294
01:07:49,159 --> 01:07:50,989
Please come along with daughter-in-law.

1295
01:07:51,213 --> 01:07:53,531
I told you that engagement and
mehandi function won't be necessary.

1296
01:07:53,731 --> 01:07:55,712
No! No! No! This is my function.

1297
01:07:55,959 --> 01:07:56,624
Yours?

1298
01:07:56,872 --> 01:08:00,014
We're celebrating my wife's baby shower.

1299
01:08:00,906 --> 01:08:04,490
Aren't you embarrassed? People will
laugh at you for having a 'seemantham' now.

1300
01:08:05,424 --> 01:08:06,734
Hello! Brother-in-law...!

1301
01:08:09,225 --> 01:08:11,273
Hey, Chanti uncle, how are you?

1302
01:08:11,945 --> 01:08:14,837
I've been waiting for you to
do something with your life.

1303
01:08:15,118 --> 01:08:16,639
But you've done nothing.

1304
01:08:16,929 --> 01:08:19,876
At this age,
this is what you've achieved.

1305
01:08:20,394 --> 01:08:20,997
Hey!

1306
01:08:21,521 --> 01:08:25,140
You're in the final stage of life,
and you've achieved nothing.

1307
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:27,872
You're here to eat, right?
Go on, stuff yourself.

1308
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,243
Get lost! Damn these relatives.

1309
01:08:30,533 --> 01:08:32,803
They cry if not invited,
and when invited, they make us cry.

1310
01:08:33,761 --> 01:08:34,365
Hi uncle!

1311
01:08:34,603 --> 01:08:36,642
-He's the legend I was talking about.-Namaskaram!

1312
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:40,107
He wanted me thank you for making
his life easier with your tips.

1313
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:42,208
God bless you! What problem do they have?

1314
01:08:42,408 --> 01:08:44,813
He's been married for 30
years, but no kids yet, uncle.

1315
01:08:45,463 --> 01:08:47,478
But look at you uncle,
hitting sixers even in sixties!

1316
01:08:47,762 --> 01:08:49,440
That's why I brought
him here for your tips.

1317
01:08:50,521 --> 01:08:52,364
Yes, sir.
They're all members of Rotary club.

1318
01:08:52,745 --> 01:08:54,159
If they become fathers thanks to you

1319
01:08:54,385 --> 01:08:57,255
they'll honor you with the title
'Father of Banjara Hills.'

1320
01:08:57,486 --> 01:08:58,549
-Promise?
-Promise, sir.

1321
01:08:59,403 --> 01:09:02,335
It's simple, son. If you want
to become a father in a month,

1322
01:09:02,736 --> 01:09:04,278
-when you wake up early in the morning...
-Uncle...!

1323
01:09:04,695 --> 01:09:07,111
Don't get confused.
I mean, when we're up in the morning.

1324
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,128
Take a handful of germinated green gram

1325
01:09:12,037 --> 01:09:13,163
What should we do with them, uncle?

1326
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:16,645
Throw them in the courtyard.
Plants will grow.

1327
01:09:16,928 --> 01:09:17,843
-You go, we will meet in the evening.
-Brother-in-law!

1328
01:09:18,043 --> 01:09:19,885
Thanks for your presence, and blessings.

1329
01:09:21,011 --> 01:09:21,942
What do you think you're doing?

1330
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:24,348
That...
just doing my part in serving the nation.

1331
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:28,072
Just the Father of Banjara Hills, or are
you aiming for Father of the Nation too?

1332
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:29,165
Thanks, dear!

1333
01:09:29,304 --> 01:09:30,721
-Sir, let it be...
-God's grace, brother-in-law.

1334
01:09:30,921 --> 01:09:33,401
Dear, your mother-in-law's waiting.
Go take her blessings, go.

1335
01:09:33,641 --> 01:09:34,285
Go, go!

1336
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:40,470
I feel embarrassed to congratulate you.

1337
01:09:41,053 --> 01:09:42,970
Saying "all the best" feels disgusting.

There's no chance to even let you be.

I don't know how to tell you.

Why all this politeness between us,

1501
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:37,434
-You should marry Nithya.
-No, sir.

1502
01:17:38,584 --> 01:17:40,703
I am a widower.

1503
01:17:42,175 --> 01:17:43,842
I will live with Dia's memories.

1504
01:17:44,509 --> 01:17:46,759
For widowers like us,

1505
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:49,592
to move on from the past...

1506
01:17:49,859 --> 01:17:51,484
Alcohol is all we've got.

1507
01:17:54,467 --> 01:17:57,227
Whenever Dia crosses your
mind, come over to my place.

1508
01:17:57,529 --> 01:18:01,281
Drink and cry as much as you can...
gradually forget Dia.

1509
01:18:01,918 --> 01:18:04,251
I'll fix your wedding date with Nithya.

1510
01:18:04,993 --> 01:18:06,028
Thank you, sir.

1511
01:18:06,276 --> 01:18:07,442
You're great.

1512
01:18:08,538 --> 01:18:12,120
Alright, sir. I'll go home and try
to ease my sorrow with this, sir.

1513
01:18:12,433 --> 01:18:13,550
I'll try to ease my sorrow with this.

1514
01:18:13,826 --> 01:18:15,570
He can't have a drink without
something to eat, sir.

1515
01:18:22,035 --> 01:18:23,655
It is called Guru Purnima.

1516
01:18:24,191 --> 01:18:26,959
-Hey, is today Guru Purnima?
-Yes, sir.

1517
01:18:27,185 --> 01:18:28,930
-Yes, sir.
-What's the timing?

1518
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:31,411
-9:30 a.m., sir.
-Oh, no!

1519
01:18:31,893 --> 01:18:32,756
He might be on his way.

1520
01:18:35,089 --> 01:18:35,810
Who, sir?

1521
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:39,902
He treats people with
dignity and respect.

1522
01:18:40,266 --> 01:18:42,419
He is my apprentice, Gunashekhar.

1523
01:18:45,641 --> 01:18:48,400
If he shows up, tell him
I'm not home. I will hide.

1524
01:18:48,609 --> 01:18:49,644
Master...

1525
01:18:51,558 --> 01:18:53,267
-Is Sir not around?
-Sir has gone out.

1526
01:18:54,266 --> 01:18:56,930
No problem. I'll take his
sandals and carry out the ritual.

1527
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,604
-I'll carry out the ritual.
-Hey!

1528
01:18:59,639 --> 01:19:01,387
-Master!
-Those sandals are worth 30,000 rupees

1529
01:19:01,599 --> 01:19:02,491
I'm here, right?

1530
01:19:03,325 --> 01:19:05,410
Give me your legs, Guru!

1531
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:07,828
Master, do you know the blessing

1532
01:19:08,029 --> 01:19:09,175
of washing the Guru's
feet on Guru Purnima

1533
01:19:09,375 --> 01:19:10,535
while singing songs from the movie
"Guru"?

1534
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:14,701
Micro plastics are
harmful to environment.

1535
01:19:14,974 --> 01:19:19,699
[Singing, song from "Guru" movie]

1536
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,536
Hey, please stop it!

1537
01:19:24,736 --> 01:19:26,667
-It's finished.
-Stop it, boy.

1538
01:19:26,946 --> 01:19:30,407
It doesn't seem like a ritual offering of
milk, it looks like you are doing Pedicure.

1539
01:19:30,804 --> 01:19:32,785
Oh no! Take it.

1540
01:19:33,651 --> 01:19:34,635
Argh!

1541
01:19:34,835 --> 01:19:35,956
I'm lucky!

1542
01:19:38,137 --> 01:19:40,417
Why take this milk?
Are you going to make tea at home?

1543
01:19:41,053 --> 01:19:42,558
Sir, this milk is as sacred
to me as Ganga water.

1544
01:19:43,141 --> 01:19:45,248
A few drops of this milk
on my head every night

1545
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:48,375
until Guru Purnima
brings pleasant dreams.

1546
01:19:48,641 --> 01:19:50,454
I was just a street lawyer once.

1547
01:19:50,654 --> 01:19:54,931
When the tree was cut for road widening,
he turned into a banyan and sheltered me.

1548
01:19:56,183 --> 01:19:59,873
And now I've started practicing
law, it's all because of you, Master.

1549
01:20:00,264 --> 01:20:01,459
Praise to Guru!

1550
01:20:02,516 --> 01:20:04,545
Master, the milk became even
whiter after washing your feet.

1551
01:20:05,071 --> 01:20:05,699
Hi, Guna...

1552
01:20:05,899 --> 01:20:07,813
-Has the milk offering been completed?
-Just finished, Ma'am.

1553
01:20:08,126 --> 01:20:09,742
An instant of incredible scenes.

1554
01:20:09,767 --> 01:20:12,567
-I can show you again if you want.
-Hey, it's not necessary.

1555
01:20:12,942 --> 01:20:14,491
What's that gift basket?

1556
01:20:14,882 --> 01:20:16,944
Sleepless for three nights,

1557
01:20:16,969 --> 01:20:19,881
I pondered what gift could
honor such a Master and decided.

1558
01:20:20,398 --> 01:20:22,730
This is it. Please accept this, Master.

1559
01:20:24,107 --> 01:20:25,690
Oh no!
Are you opening it in front of me?

1560
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:31,164
Oh my God! I am feeling shy.

1561
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:32,329
-Oh no!
-What's this gift, boy?

1562
01:20:33,607 --> 01:20:34,732
Don't you get it?

1563
01:20:35,274 --> 01:20:37,446
These six flowers and
three fruits symbolize

1564
01:20:37,471 --> 01:20:39,174
how my life has blossomed
and grown because of you.

1565
01:20:39,565 --> 01:20:40,773
Your work has been completed, right?

1566
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,700
I won't be around on Teacher's Day,
so don't come looking for me.

1567
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:45,472
-Where are you going?
-I'm not going to say.

1568
01:20:45,497 --> 01:20:47,191
No worries, my tracker on your phone
will make sure I know where you go.

1569
01:20:47,216 --> 01:20:49,044
-Hey!
-I'm only kidding, Master.

1570
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:50,783
Master!

1571
01:20:52,091 --> 01:20:53,942
Salt? You'll find it inside.

1572
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:56,373
Why does he need salt, sir?

1573
01:20:56,573 --> 01:21:01,292
He takes salt from me every
month, not to forget that,

1574
01:21:01,317 --> 01:21:04,076
he came to this stage eating my salt.

1575
01:21:04,398 --> 01:21:05,504
Mad fellow.

1576
01:21:07,368 --> 01:21:08,366
-Gautham?
-Yes.

1577
01:21:08,577 --> 01:21:10,197
Have you submitted the certificate
the registrar requested?

1578
01:21:10,397 --> 01:21:10,853
Yeah.

1579
01:21:11,053 --> 01:21:12,768
They'll fix our wedding
date in a day or two.

1580
01:21:13,175 --> 01:21:16,180
Now, not even God can stop our wedding.

1581
01:21:17,728 --> 01:21:21,560
-Dude! The new team lead is so stunning!
-Please!

1582
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,328
We already have a stunning beauty here.

1583
01:21:24,552 --> 01:21:26,208
-Look...
-There's absolutely no chance.

1584
01:21:43,071 --> 01:21:44,841
-Oh no! Why did she come here?
-Welcome madam.

1585
01:21:45,114 --> 01:21:45,891
-Hi!
-Hi!

1586
01:21:46,091 --> 01:21:46,927
-Hi!
-Welcome ma'am!

1587
01:21:47,127 --> 01:21:47,910
Thank you so much!

1588
01:21:48,110 --> 01:21:48,623
-Very kind of you!
-Hello!

1589
01:21:50,141 --> 01:21:51,180
-Bro.
-Hey, wait!

1590
01:21:51,438 --> 01:21:53,160
Ma'am, that's Gautham.

1591
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,767
-He's on our team.
-Excuse me, Gautham!

1592
01:22:05,807 --> 01:22:06,332
Hi!

1593
01:22:07,163 --> 01:22:09,537
-Shall we go?
-Yeah.

1594
01:22:10,724 --> 01:22:11,558
My Team lead?

1595
01:22:13,705 --> 01:22:15,389
Hey, come here! There's something here.

1596
01:22:15,645 --> 01:22:17,077
No, I'll take it out.

1597
01:22:17,334 --> 01:22:18,874
Let me!

1598
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,730
-Hi!
-Hi, ma'am!

1599
01:22:25,396 --> 01:22:27,563
You two seem very close?!

1600
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:30,230
Let me guess.

1601
01:22:31,063 --> 01:22:32,039
Are you two dating?

1602
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,500
We're getting married, ma'am!

1603
01:22:35,271 --> 01:22:36,605
Oh!

1604
01:22:36,821 --> 01:22:38,530
-Congrats, Gautham!
-Thanks, ma'am!

1605
01:22:38,905 --> 01:22:40,927
-Is it love or arranged?
-Love marriage, ma'am.

1606
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:45,047
You said you wouldn't
love anyone else but me.

1607
01:22:45,247 --> 01:22:47,449
It's okay if you get married,
so is it wrong if I fall in love?

1608
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:50,976
Gautham brought your
relationship to marriage,

1609
01:22:51,176 --> 01:22:52,697
so his love must be genuine.

1610
01:22:52,921 --> 01:22:57,269
I guess he's into things
like chest tattoos in love.

1611
01:22:57,987 --> 01:23:00,004
-What do you mean?
-Don't reveal it, please.

1612
01:23:00,204 --> 01:23:04,223
He did it, ma'am.
Seeing that made me love him even more.

1613
01:23:04,634 --> 01:23:06,100
Have you seen it?

1614
01:23:06,446 --> 01:23:07,343
I've seen it, ma'am.

1615
01:23:07,942 --> 01:23:09,116
Did he tattoo your name?

1616
01:23:09,515 --> 01:23:12,537
-It's actually India.
-India means so much to me.

1617
01:23:13,545 --> 01:23:16,121
I'd rather watch the
IPL than the World Cup.

1618
01:23:16,674 --> 01:23:18,022
You turned Dia, into India.

1619
01:23:19,209 --> 01:23:21,329
You tried to pin me down,
but it won't work. It'll be tough.

1620
01:23:21,544 --> 01:23:22,864
Just wait, I'll get you.

1621
01:23:24,498 --> 01:23:25,948
-See you!
-Yeah.

1622
01:23:29,339 --> 01:23:31,584
Hey bro, I need a xerox of this.

1623
01:23:36,005 --> 01:23:37,445
Man, this looks like a love letter.

1624
01:23:37,954 --> 01:23:40,532
Yes, bro!
The same letter worked for my friend.

1625
01:23:40,813 --> 01:23:42,586
So I decided to give her the same letter.

1626
01:23:42,821 --> 01:23:44,365
Then why not write the same letter?

1627
01:23:45,368 --> 01:23:47,438
I can write it,
but my handwriting's terrible.

1628
01:23:47,827 --> 01:23:49,060
Won't she feel bad about the copy?

1629
01:23:49,343 --> 01:23:51,387
I'm giving the letter so
she feels what I feel.

1630
01:23:51,587 --> 01:23:54,223
Bro, stop advising me.
Just give me the copy. I need to go.

1631
01:23:54,698 --> 01:23:56,233
Keep yourself away from the first-years.

1632
01:23:57,926 --> 01:23:58,764
Thank you, bro!

1633
01:23:59,551 --> 01:24:00,689
What's wrong with you, dude?

1634
01:24:02,183 --> 01:24:03,961
I thought Dia would never
come back into my life.

1635
01:24:04,161 --> 01:24:05,493
Why would she come back
after we drove her away?

1636
01:24:05,693 --> 01:24:09,083
Damn it. She showed up as my team leader.

1637
01:24:09,286 --> 01:24:10,453
Man, you're really unlucky.

1638
01:24:10,771 --> 01:24:13,328
Your ex-girlfriend and
present... under the same roof.

1639
01:24:15,025 --> 01:24:16,926
Did she tell Nithya about it?

1640
01:24:17,188 --> 01:24:18,227
That's the only thing left.

1641
01:24:18,615 --> 01:24:20,393
I need to get married
before she spills this

1642
01:24:25,078 --> 01:24:26,286
Why is he calling me now?

1643
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:29,082
-Please go ahead.
-I've finalized your wedding date.

1644
01:24:29,311 --> 01:24:31,894
-Sir?!-Change your thinking to end yourself.

1645
01:24:32,254 --> 01:24:33,544
You're getting married
on the 22nd this month.

1646
01:24:33,744 --> 01:24:35,788
Thank God. Thank you, sir.

1647
01:24:35,813 --> 01:24:36,538
Thank you!

1648
01:24:36,949 --> 01:24:38,873
Do you still have Dia on your mind?

1649
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:40,801
Yeah, sir!

1650
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:44,632
The only way to relieve your
pain is through alcohol.

1651
01:24:45,504 --> 01:24:48,251
-Come to Mahaprasadam wine mart.
-Certainly, sir.

1652
01:24:50,815 --> 01:24:52,410
Why are you inspecting
everything and putting it away?

1653
01:24:53,106 --> 01:24:56,362
Everything here is 12 years 18 years old.
Seems they're out of fresh stock

1654
01:24:57,315 --> 01:24:59,243
He doesn't even know
the basics about liquor.

1655
01:24:59,443 --> 01:25:01,844
Sir, the older the liquor,
the better the high.

1656
01:25:02,648 --> 01:25:04,674
-What would you like to have?
-Signature.

1657
01:25:05,648 --> 01:25:07,107
He needs a signature here as well.

1658
01:25:08,565 --> 01:25:11,060
-What would you like to have?
-We will...

1659
01:25:11,575 --> 01:25:12,987
Stop him. He might open it here itself.

1660
01:25:14,323 --> 01:25:15,156
This one, sir.

1661
01:25:15,517 --> 01:25:16,868
-40 thousand?!
-Yeah.

1662
01:25:17,068 --> 01:25:18,167
-This is mine.
-Okay.

1663
01:25:19,899 --> 01:25:20,621
Dia...

1664
01:25:21,573 --> 01:25:23,530
Her image keeps flashing in my mind.

1665
01:25:23,796 --> 01:25:24,720
We'll take this.

1666
01:25:25,324 --> 01:25:26,650
Let's keep it within our limits.

1667
01:25:27,093 --> 01:25:28,866
-That brand's always like this.
-Dia...

1668
01:25:31,141 --> 01:25:33,785
-Sir!
-Hand me the keys, I'll get the car.

1669
01:25:33,985 --> 01:25:36,659
No. Handing over the car cost me my wife.

1670
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:39,019
-Come.
-Sir, relax. I'll handle it.

1671
01:25:40,363 --> 01:25:41,502
Do you see anyone over there?

1672
01:25:41,902 --> 01:25:43,293
No. There's nobody there.

1673
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:46,640
Sometimes,
I feel like Dia is seen in Red dress.

1674
01:25:47,026 --> 01:25:47,719
That's it.

1675
01:25:48,218 --> 01:25:49,743
-You get the car, please.
-Alright.

1676
01:25:49,969 --> 01:25:50,669
Hey, wait!

1677
01:25:54,486 --> 01:25:56,262
-Hello?
-Does ghosts use mobile?

1678
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:57,734
I am waiting in the cellar.

1679
01:25:57,766 --> 01:25:59,548
-Sir...
-Sir!

1680
01:26:00,965 --> 01:26:02,234
Weren't you dead in that accident?

1681
01:26:02,968 --> 01:26:04,865
Were your wishes left unfulfilled...
is that why you wander as a ghost?

1682
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:06,427
You're talking nonsense.

1683
01:26:09,358 --> 01:26:15,950
Dude, I asked for a divorce certificate,
why did you bring her death certificate?

1684
01:26:16,552 --> 01:26:17,982
I'll see your end.

1685
01:26:20,503 --> 01:26:21,528
Sir...

1686
01:26:26,135 --> 01:26:30,703
I'm the one who made the death
certificate. Sorry about that.

1687
01:26:31,482 --> 01:26:33,865
Do you even know how to apologize?

1688
01:26:35,099 --> 01:26:37,050
It's hard for you to say sorry, isn't it?

1689
01:26:39,988 --> 01:26:42,319
Gautham, dad has approved our marriage.

1690
01:26:43,061 --> 01:26:47,387
Seriously? He agreed?

1691
01:26:50,476 --> 01:26:53,468
-But...
-But...?

1692
01:26:53,881 --> 01:26:58,042
Say sorry at the retirement
function tomorrow.

1693
01:27:00,308 --> 01:27:01,739
-Huh-Sorry!
-Is it okay?

1694
01:27:03,045 --> 01:27:04,560
-Okay?
-I'll say.

1695
01:27:05,276 --> 01:27:06,412
-I'll say.
-Okay.

1696
01:27:06,612 --> 01:27:08,713
[crowd applause]
[camera captures]

1697
01:27:09,533 --> 01:27:13,476
Now, our student leader Gautham will
say a few words about the principal.

1698
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:26,381
Salutations to our respected
and beloved Krishna Prasad, sir.

1699
01:27:26,738 --> 01:27:28,089
Please put your hands together.

1700
01:27:29,449 --> 01:27:32,018
For twenty-five years,

1701
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:38,457
he has rendered invaluable
service to this college.

1702
01:27:40,180 --> 01:27:41,065
Please put your hands together.

1703
01:27:44,171 --> 01:27:45,996
They say I gave him a lot of trouble.

1704
01:27:47,315 --> 01:27:48,925
They say I ended up hurting his feelings.

1705
01:27:49,691 --> 01:27:53,382
This came from his daughter
because we're in love.

1706
01:27:55,305 --> 01:27:55,908
Dad!

1707
01:27:56,185 --> 01:28:01,904
He thought this was the right
platform to apologize to him.

1708
01:28:03,185 --> 01:28:05,630
Forgive me, sir. I'm sorry.

1709
01:28:07,151 --> 01:28:10,198
Ultimately, you achieved your goal
by turning your daughter into a pawn.

1710
01:28:11,613 --> 01:28:14,109
Congratulations! I'll take my leave.

1711
01:28:17,911 --> 01:28:23,098
If you had no intention of saying sorry,
you should've told me upfront.

1712
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:26,802
Who gave you the right to
insult in front of everyone?

1713
01:28:27,396 --> 01:28:31,004
Retirement is a special
moment in anyone's life

1714
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:34,188
On a day like this,
you humiliated my father before everyone.

1715
01:28:34,388 --> 01:28:35,889
Your father doesn't have
much of a reputation.

1716
01:28:36,089 --> 01:28:38,082
How dare you talk about
my father like that?

1717
01:28:40,997 --> 01:28:42,340
You've made a mistake.

1718
01:28:43,115 --> 01:28:46,525
You will come and apologize to my father.

1719
01:28:48,671 --> 01:28:51,267
An apology to your dad? Never.

1720
01:28:51,467 --> 01:28:53,844
It was for me that my dad
gave you that opportunity.

1721
01:28:54,379 --> 01:28:56,425
You can't apologize even for my sake?

1722
01:28:57,705 --> 01:29:00,266
I feel safer with my dad than with you.

1723
01:29:00,661 --> 01:29:01,916
If you felt that way,

1724
01:29:02,466 --> 01:29:04,671
why did you even come to the
registrar's office? Why marry at all?

1725
01:29:04,871 --> 01:29:07,037
That wasn't a marriage.
It was only two signatures.

1726
01:29:08,438 --> 01:29:09,951
Once the paper is torn, everything ends.

1727
01:29:10,198 --> 01:29:13,080
Because I thought only about you,
I ended up being cheap.

1728
01:29:13,845 --> 01:29:16,655
The thought of a future
with you scares me.

1729
01:29:16,994 --> 01:29:19,137
If you're that scared, don't
live with me. Just get lost.

1730
01:29:22,195 --> 01:29:23,243
I hate you.

1731
01:29:28,106 --> 01:29:31,811
If you don't call it a marriage,
tear those certificates.

1732
01:29:32,574 --> 01:29:33,767
I'll tear them too.

1733
01:29:46,305 --> 01:29:48,043
No, sir. Please.

1734
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:52,066
What happened, sir?
You asked me to come immediately.

1735
01:29:52,535 --> 01:29:53,808
I've fixed your wedding date.

1736
01:29:54,776 --> 01:29:55,794
On the 20th of this month.

1737
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:56,759
Thanks!

1738
01:29:57,452 --> 01:29:58,877
Thank you, sir.
Thank you so much.

1739
01:29:59,064 --> 01:30:00,811
-I'll go and inform my father.
-Go ahead. I'll join you.

1740
01:30:02,109 --> 01:30:03,295
You're really great, sir.

1741
01:30:03,595 --> 01:30:06,262
Without holding on to the
past, you fixed the wedding date.

1742
01:30:06,712 --> 01:30:08,932
-Thank you so much, sir.
-Who said I've forgotten the past?

1743
01:30:09,844 --> 01:30:12,510
You'll get married only after submitting
the divorce certificate before the 20th.

1744
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,546
How am I supposed to get a
divorce certificate within 20 days, sir?

1745
01:30:14,646 --> 01:30:17,260
You managed a death certificate in
two days. This shouldn't be hard for you.

1746
01:30:17,865 --> 01:30:19,792
If you don't mind, please
postpone it just one last time.

1747
01:30:20,073 --> 01:30:20,617
No!

1748
01:30:20,817 --> 01:30:22,839
Postpone it? Why?

1749
01:30:23,942 --> 01:30:28,527
My father's birthday falls on the 20th,
and we used to celebrate it grandly.

1750
01:30:28,799 --> 01:30:31,217
Is there any chance of
pushing it by a few days?

1751
01:30:31,741 --> 01:30:32,977
Shall we preponing
it by two days?

1752
01:30:33,482 --> 01:30:35,642
No, sir. Let's fix it on the 20th.

1753
01:30:35,909 --> 01:30:36,582
Leave.

1754
01:30:40,609 --> 01:30:42,303
-I will...
-Please, sir. Just this one time.

1755
01:30:44,093 --> 01:30:45,166
Okay, sir. Thank you, sir.

1756
01:30:45,412 --> 01:30:46,199
Please! Please!

1757
01:30:50,664 --> 01:30:52,075
Why is he so tense?

1758
01:30:53,263 --> 01:30:54,423
What's wrong with you?

1759
01:30:54,702 --> 01:30:56,677
Registrar Satyamurthy
has fixed the wedding date.

1760
01:30:56,877 --> 01:30:57,582
Okay!

1761
01:30:57,829 --> 01:30:59,433
He's threatening to tell Nithya everything
if I fail to get the divorce certificate.

1762
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,795
-Oh!
-The wedding is in 15 days.

1763
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:03,986
How do I get a divorce
certificate immediately?

1764
01:31:04,262 --> 01:31:07,562
Hey, panicking won't
get you a solution.

1765
01:31:07,881 --> 01:31:10,865
Let's consult a lawyer and
explain our situation to him.

1766
01:31:11,168 --> 01:31:12,361
He'll find a solution for us.

1767
01:31:14,659 --> 01:31:17,010
Where can I find a
really good lawyer?

1768
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:19,216
Good lawyers sit in
court, not in the market.

1769
01:31:19,649 --> 01:31:20,316
Noted.

1770
01:31:20,703 --> 01:31:21,369
The court.

1771
01:31:24,539 --> 01:31:26,169
-What case is this?
-It's a divorce case, sir.

1772
01:31:26,554 --> 01:31:27,999
Why are you opting for a divorce?

1773
01:31:28,196 --> 01:31:29,159
Because I want to get married again.

1774
01:31:29,708 --> 01:31:30,614
What is your wife's stance on this?

1775
01:31:30,896 --> 01:31:32,274
-My wife has already remarried.
-Yeah!

1776
01:31:32,497 --> 01:31:33,115
Oh!

1777
01:31:33,516 --> 01:31:34,748
-Are you his father?
-Yes, sir.

1778
01:31:35,028 --> 01:31:36,575
Didn't you tell him that
marrying again is wrong?

1779
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:38,968
I can't say that, sir, because
I myself remarried recently.

1780
01:31:39,646 --> 01:31:41,493
So, father and son share the same genes.

1781
01:31:41,753 --> 01:31:43,168
We both wear Mufti jeans,
sir. We keep swapping them.

1782
01:31:43,251 --> 01:31:44,222
I'm not talking about the jeans.
-You stop!

1783
01:31:44,682 --> 01:31:47,132
Please complete the divorce
proceedings before the 20th, sir.

1784
01:31:47,273 --> 01:31:48,271
What's so urgent?

1785
01:31:48,557 --> 01:31:49,945
-Because...
-He's getting married on the 20th, sir.

1786
01:31:50,469 --> 01:31:52,004
You fixed the wedding date
before the divorce was done?

1787
01:31:52,104 --> 01:31:52,557
Yes.

1788
01:31:52,657 --> 01:31:55,128
-Why did you get married the first time?
-It just happened casually, sir.

1789
01:31:55,401 --> 01:31:56,803
-And now?
-Now I've decided seriously.

1790
01:31:57,003 --> 01:31:58,904
Should I handle this
case casually or seriously?

1791
01:31:59,209 --> 01:32:01,236
Be serious with the case
and make the divorce simple.

1792
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:02,157
Oh God!

1793
01:32:02,374 --> 01:32:03,034
Stamp!

1794
01:32:03,305 --> 01:32:04,811
-Your wife has already remarried, right?
-Yes.

1795
01:32:05,157 --> 01:32:07,344
-Then why not you?
-I don't have that option, sir.

1796
01:32:07,565 --> 01:32:09,095
My father-in-law insists it should
happen only at the registrar's office.

1797
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:11,365
The registrar refuses to go
ahead without the divorce papers.

1798
01:32:11,683 --> 01:32:12,805
Why is the registrar refusing?

1799
01:32:13,256 --> 01:32:15,313
Actually, my first wedding
took place at the same office.

1800
01:32:15,813 --> 01:32:16,919
Oh no!

1801
01:32:19,188 --> 01:32:20,538
From what I see, you're too restless.

1802
01:32:20,678 --> 01:32:21,505
[both]: Correct, sir!

1803
01:32:22,384 --> 01:32:23,546
-Sorry!
-I mean to say...

1804
01:32:23,989 --> 01:32:27,263
It's easy to get married,
but divorce is complicated.

1805
01:32:27,463 --> 01:32:28,329
There are some legal
steps you must follow.

1806
01:32:28,695 --> 01:32:31,516
The first step is that you need
her signature on the divorce papers.

1807
01:32:31,821 --> 01:32:34,531
Do you mean my ex-wife's
signature or the future one's?

1808
01:32:35,527 --> 01:32:37,133
-Could you ask him to wait outside?
-Dad, please wait outside.

1809
01:32:37,486 --> 01:32:39,328
That's exactly why
I don't recommend amateur lawyers.

1810
01:32:40,486 --> 01:32:41,174
What's the second step?

1811
01:32:41,431 --> 01:32:43,193
Step two is that
both of you must attend counseling.

1812
01:32:44,005 --> 01:32:48,350
The third stage is a court hearing
involving both parties and her family.

1813
01:32:48,775 --> 01:32:51,190
Sir, won't all this take too long?
Is there an express option?

1814
01:32:51,841 --> 01:32:53,484
-Can you ask him to stay outside, please?
-Go.

1815
01:32:54,862 --> 01:32:57,978
Sir, I can manage forged papers,
but she won't come to court.

1816
01:32:58,224 --> 01:33:00,517
Can I replace her with
another girl and manage it?

1817
01:33:00,717 --> 01:33:01,588
I have plenty of options for that.

1818
01:33:01,832 --> 01:33:03,152
-Hey!
-I have plenty of options, sir.

1819
01:33:03,397 --> 01:33:04,641
I've got options, sir,
just not enough time.

1820
01:33:05,283 --> 01:33:07,458
Alright. I'll leave the room.

1821
01:33:08,354 --> 01:33:09,968
[indistinct voices]
-Hey!

1822
01:33:10,368 --> 01:33:11,281
-We got caught!
-Oh!

1823
01:33:11,936 --> 01:33:12,727
What brings you here?

1824
01:33:12,867 --> 01:33:14,661
[both]: Thing is...

1825
01:33:15,101 --> 01:33:15,801
To file a divorce case.

1826
01:33:16,201 --> 01:33:17,328
Divorce? Who's filing for it?

1827
01:33:17,772 --> 01:33:19,595
-I haven't gotten married yet.
-It's for my dad.

1828
01:33:20,279 --> 01:33:21,631
Really? What's the reason?

1829
01:33:21,918 --> 01:33:24,929
My dad belongs to the '60s,
and my mom is pure Gen Z.

1830
01:33:25,226 --> 01:33:28,446
She shared a picture online, and
someone commented, "You look beautiful."

1831
01:33:28,779 --> 01:33:32,938
My mom just replied, "Thank
you" with a heart emoji. That's all, sir.

1832
01:33:33,187 --> 01:33:36,314
He began verbally blasting her,
like YouTube promoter clashes.

1833
01:33:36,831 --> 01:33:38,641
-That's just an heart emoji, right?
-For you it may just an emoji,

1834
01:33:39,216 --> 01:33:41,636
For him it's a plain heart, and for
him it's a symbol of love. That's it.

1835
01:33:41,834 --> 01:33:44,950
Doubting her, he dragged situation to
court. All because of the generation gap.

1836
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:46,439
You celebrated a baby
shower recently, right?

1837
01:33:46,645 --> 01:33:47,113
Yes, sir!

1838
01:33:47,363 --> 01:33:48,524
What's your plan once
the divorce is done?

1839
01:33:48,724 --> 01:33:50,019
Possibly for a remarriage, sir.

1840
01:33:52,115 --> 01:33:53,654
What terrible
behavior at this age!

1841
01:33:53,965 --> 01:33:55,518
What message
are you sending to society with this?

1842
01:33:55,812 --> 01:33:57,578
-What are you trying to say?
-Maybe no one should be like him.

1843
01:33:57,778 --> 01:33:58,303
Correct!

1844
01:33:58,503 --> 01:34:00,346
It's done. I've tolerated you enough.

1845
01:34:00,666 --> 01:34:03,342
Building a relationship with
someone like you is a sin.

1846
01:34:03,745 --> 01:34:04,936
I'm calling Nithya right away.

1847
01:34:05,166 --> 01:34:07,582
Uncle, let's resolve
this through discussion.

1848
01:34:08,407 --> 01:34:09,227
Where are you, Nithya?

1849
01:34:11,208 --> 01:34:13,672
I don't feel right calling
you 'father-in-law'.

1850
01:34:14,598 --> 01:34:17,069
Do you even understand
what you are doing?

1851
01:34:17,488 --> 01:34:18,278
That's how you should ask, Nithya.

1852
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:19,931
Why aren't you saying anything?

1853
01:34:20,165 --> 01:34:24,177
When Saturn's influence is on us,
even the right feels wrong, dear.

1854
01:34:24,477 --> 01:34:26,610
Calling someone 'dear'
is treated like a sin.

1855
01:34:27,226 --> 01:34:28,725
I can't stand this family.

1856
01:34:29,399 --> 01:34:32,676
Seeing what he's done, I feel like
stopping the wedding right away.

1857
01:34:32,904 --> 01:34:34,821
What are you saying, sir?
You're an excellent lawyer.

1858
01:34:35,348 --> 01:34:39,702
Imagine a 60-year-old savage who murders
someone and also robs on the way.

1859
01:34:39,995 --> 01:34:40,622
So what?

1860
01:34:40,808 --> 01:34:43,825
Will you punish the man who
committed the crime or his son?

1861
01:34:44,034 --> 01:34:45,014
Why punish the son?

1862
01:34:45,291 --> 01:34:46,672
-I'll punish the man.
-Exactly.

1863
01:34:47,438 --> 01:34:50,031
If my father committed the crime,
why am I being punished?

1864
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,401
-Yes, dad. He's right.
-Yeah!

1865
01:34:52,981 --> 01:34:53,967
Listen, dear.
Knowing everything,

1866
01:34:54,074 --> 01:34:55,994
-I can't send you to their house.
-Don't send, sir.

1867
01:34:56,422 --> 01:34:57,304
I'll come to your house myself.

1868
01:34:58,139 --> 01:34:59,472
I may hate it, but he's still my father.

1869
01:34:59,965 --> 01:35:01,256
Just endure him until
the wedding happens.

1870
01:35:01,571 --> 01:35:02,659
Let him answer for his own actions.

1871
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:04,977
Do whatever you want.

1872
01:35:05,185 --> 01:35:05,918
Dad!

1873
01:35:06,249 --> 01:35:06,963
What's this Gautham?

1874
01:35:07,504 --> 01:35:08,242
Dad!

1875
01:35:08,664 --> 01:35:09,339
-Nithya...
-Hey!

1876
01:35:09,919 --> 01:35:14,803
History's worst son was Aurangzeb. He
imprisoned his own father for the throne.

1877
01:35:15,155 --> 01:35:17,638
You destroyed my marriage life
just to save yours.

1878
01:35:18,566 --> 01:35:20,347
-Dad!
-Shut up! Aurangzeb!

1879
01:35:21,161 --> 01:35:24,923
God! How will Chinnu take this?
She's pregnant.

1880
01:35:25,668 --> 01:35:26,673
Aurangzeb!

1881
01:35:32,841 --> 01:35:35,263
Hey,
you kept madam's photo as a wallpaper.

1882
01:35:35,533 --> 01:35:36,420
What's wrong in that?

1883
01:35:36,736 --> 01:35:38,509
She is married. It's wrong. Remove it.

1884
01:35:39,236 --> 01:35:40,774
Hey, I am also married.

1885
01:35:41,175 --> 01:35:43,165
It's wrong for a married man to look
at unmarried women.

1886
01:35:43,343 --> 01:35:45,470
But it's not wrong for
a married man to look at married women.

1887
01:35:45,632 --> 01:35:46,302
I won't remove it.

1888
01:35:46,726 --> 01:35:47,380
Remove it first.

1889
01:35:48,049 --> 01:35:50,722
Buddy, you asked me to remove
your girlfriend's photo. I've removed it.

1890
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:52,843
But I won't remove her photo.

1891
01:35:53,014 --> 01:35:55,196
-Remove it. If you don't, I will...
-I won't, bro...

1892
01:35:56,198 --> 01:35:57,102
What's this discussion?

1893
01:35:58,684 --> 01:36:00,105
He kept your photo as a wallpaper.

1894
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:01,121
He's not removing
it, even though I told him to.

1895
01:36:03,162 --> 01:36:04,084
Why did you keep it?

1896
01:36:04,451 --> 01:36:05,373
For inspiration, madam.

1897
01:36:05,712 --> 01:36:07,378
I wanted to be a great
architect like you.

1898
01:36:07,559 --> 01:36:09,458
Motivation. Manifestation also.

1899
01:36:11,788 --> 01:36:13,339
He said you're
a great architect. Don't believe him.

1900
01:36:15,825 --> 01:36:18,598
I asked you to complete the
design of the Oberoi hotel, right?

1901
01:36:18,847 --> 01:36:19,799
-Yes.
-Did you do it?

1902
01:36:19,929 --> 01:36:20,529
Yes, I did.

1903
01:36:21,073 --> 01:36:22,024
Then come and present it.

1904
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:23,908
Go.

1905
01:36:24,557 --> 01:36:25,785
Remove that photo first.

1906
01:36:31,173 --> 01:36:32,295
I am giving you all a guarantee.

1907
01:36:33,265 --> 01:36:36,019
What you're about to witness...
you've never seen before.

1908
01:36:36,372 --> 01:36:37,791
Yet, it'll feel strangely familiar.

1909
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:38,800
In fact...

1910
01:36:39,281 --> 01:36:40,737
This is the world's best, creative,

1911
01:36:40,884 --> 01:36:43,491
fantastic, marvelous design,
visionary created by an architect.

1912
01:36:43,922 --> 01:36:45,349
In this, people who are married can come.

1913
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:46,613
People who are unmarried can come.

1914
01:36:47,253 --> 01:36:50,859
People who got registrar marriage in hasty
when they were young can come.

1915
01:36:51,591 --> 01:36:54,124
People who are trying to get
divorced after getting married can come.

1916
01:36:54,381 --> 01:36:56,908
People who did second marriage
without getting divorced can also come.

1917
01:36:57,065 --> 01:36:57,645
Enough, enough.

1918
01:36:57,999 --> 01:37:00,066
The hotel management will
decide who can come and who can't.

1919
01:37:00,249 --> 01:37:00,876
Correct.

1920
01:37:03,683 --> 01:37:05,494
-That's quite an interesting design.
-Thank you.

1921
01:37:05,938 --> 01:37:06,809
But...

1922
01:37:07,176 --> 01:37:11,146
The way you put it...
it feels oddly familiar.

1923
01:37:11,383 --> 01:37:12,230
I've mentioned this before.

1924
01:37:12,936 --> 01:37:13,934
It's just a feeling.

1925
01:37:15,239 --> 01:37:16,864
-Let's see.
-Okay!

1926
01:37:23,938 --> 01:37:24,725
Surprising!

1927
01:37:25,158 --> 01:37:26,952
Looks like this architect
has copied my idea.

1928
01:37:27,304 --> 01:37:30,160
He didn't copy you.
You copied him, idiot.

1929
01:37:31,829 --> 01:37:32,583
Look, ma'am!

1930
01:37:33,083 --> 01:37:34,690
There's no harm
if two people arrive at the same idea.

1931
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:36,107
It's called parallel
thinking.

1932
01:37:36,447 --> 01:37:38,138
Plagiarism is a crime Mr. Gautham.

1933
01:37:38,357 --> 01:37:39,186
What is plagiarism?

1934
01:37:39,862 --> 01:37:40,570
Shut up and get out.

1935
01:37:40,798 --> 01:37:42,253
-Everyone, please disperse.
-Okay! Get out.

1936
01:37:42,457 --> 01:37:43,491
-Everyone disperse. Go!
-You too.

1937
01:37:43,861 --> 01:37:45,561
Madam, I need to talk to you in person.

1938
01:37:46,117 --> 01:37:46,837
What do you mean by personal?

1939
01:37:48,981 --> 01:37:51,619
It's a professional matter,
but I'd prefer to discuss it in private.

1940
01:37:51,959 --> 01:37:52,986
-Oh!
-Yes! Go.

1941
01:37:53,485 --> 01:37:55,402
I'll apologize and come back. You leave.

1942
01:37:55,623 --> 01:37:56,405
-Leave.
-Hmm!

1943
01:37:58,059 --> 01:37:58,912
-Diya!
-Hmm

1944
01:37:59,132 --> 01:38:02,600
If you sign these divorce papers, we
can both cleanse ourselves of our sins.

1945
01:38:03,062 --> 01:38:03,898
-Both?
-Yes!

1946
01:38:04,255 --> 01:38:05,441
I haven't committed any sin.

1947
01:38:05,731 --> 01:38:06,609
Hey! Not you, it's just me.

1948
01:38:06,871 --> 01:38:08,830
-Correct!
-I'm the sinner.

1949
01:38:09,156 --> 01:38:10,866
My life and my wife are at your mercy.

1950
01:38:11,114 --> 01:38:12,233
Just one signature will do, please.

1951
01:38:13,427 --> 01:38:15,576
Confess everything you did to Nithya.

1952
01:38:15,874 --> 01:38:16,674
I'll sign.

1953
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:18,334
Did you
confess everything to your husband?

1954
01:38:18,626 --> 01:38:21,009
-Yes, I informed.
-Did you inform?

1955
01:38:21,209 --> 01:38:21,888
Who's the unfortunate man?

1956
01:38:22,088 --> 01:38:24,012
-Is that guy starving or what?
-Get the hell out of here.

1957
01:38:24,316 --> 01:38:25,296
-Will you leave or shall I call Nithya?
-Fine, I'm leaving.

1958
01:38:25,423 --> 01:38:26,666
-Nithya...
-Oh no! okay.

1959
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:32,855
-What are those, Sreenu?
-Sir!

1960
01:38:33,184 --> 01:38:34,294
Has ma'am signed?

1961
01:38:34,524 --> 01:38:35,254
Yes, sir. It's done.

1962
01:38:36,217 --> 01:38:37,728
-How's everyone at home?
-Everyone's doing fine, sir.

1963
01:38:39,472 --> 01:38:40,964
-What's your son studying?
-He's in fourth class.

1964
01:38:41,203 --> 01:38:42,100
Okay, leave.

1965
01:38:44,030 --> 01:38:45,313
Why are there so many curves in signature?

1966
01:38:46,270 --> 01:38:48,284
There's a curve like
a pole and a snake.

1967
01:38:48,921 --> 01:38:49,948
There are two smaller snakes.

1968
01:38:50,072 --> 01:38:50,651
An onion.

1969
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:52,441
A tail below that.

1970
01:38:52,787 --> 01:38:54,424
That's all. I'm truly amazing.

1971
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:03,828
You forgot to
add two dots down there.

1972
01:39:04,098 --> 01:39:04,751
Correct!

1973
01:39:07,559 --> 01:39:08,383
Yes. Correct!

1974
01:39:09,236 --> 01:39:10,423
Have you started forging documents too?

1975
01:39:10,643 --> 01:39:11,267
What's this?

1976
01:39:11,474 --> 01:39:13,160
Copying the signature
of influential people counts as forgery.

1977
01:39:13,368 --> 01:39:15,626
-When it's yours, it doesn't even count.
-Then, what is it called?

1978
01:39:15,807 --> 01:39:17,661
-You left me with no choice.
-What are you talking about?

1979
01:39:18,509 --> 01:39:20,270
That is...
Tomorrow is your birthday, right?

1980
01:39:20,636 --> 01:39:22,136
I am asking her to come for sure.

1981
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:24,929
-Ma'am please do come for sure.
-Of course, yes.

1982
01:39:25,911 --> 01:39:27,438
-Please continue!
-Yeah!

1983
01:39:29,757 --> 01:39:31,908
Hello! Greetings! Come in.

1984
01:39:32,144 --> 01:39:33,397
-Greetings!
-How are you? Go inside.

1985
01:39:33,598 --> 01:39:34,524
-Greetings, brother!
-Greetings!

1986
01:39:34,944 --> 01:39:36,951
Excuse me, why are you crying?

1987
01:39:37,183 --> 01:39:38,105
-Sir!
-Hey!

1988
01:39:39,133 --> 01:39:41,117
-What wrong with you?
-I've brought this.

1989
01:39:41,230 --> 01:39:43,130
Hey, why did you bring a
milk packet to this event?

1990
01:39:43,208 --> 01:39:44,363
Today's Guru Nanak's
birth anniversary, right?

1991
01:39:44,656 --> 01:39:46,439
I Brought this "Country Delight"
milk to clean your feet, sir.

1992
01:39:46,695 --> 01:39:48,822
What link is there between the teacher
and Guru Nanak?

1993
01:39:48,988 --> 01:39:49,974
I don't know.

1994
01:39:50,214 --> 01:39:52,560
If the word 'guru' (teacher) is in
a festival, I immediately feel connected.

1995
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:53,915
-Please remove your shoes.
-Hey!

1996
01:39:54,362 --> 01:39:57,408
I'll kick you out if you keep roaming
around like a milk distributor.

1997
01:39:58,014 --> 01:39:59,235
-I'm not your teacher,
-Greetings, sir!

1998
01:39:59,442 --> 01:40:00,562
and you're not my student here.

1999
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:02,110
-You're our family friend.
-Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

2000
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:04,630
I asked you to come
with your family. Where is your wife?

2001
01:40:04,889 --> 01:40:05,830
She's with her boyfriend.

2002
01:40:06,381 --> 01:40:07,676
-Friend?
-With her ex-boyfriend, sir.

2003
01:40:08,218 --> 01:40:09,650
-Ex-boyfriend?
-Yes, sir.

2004
01:40:10,145 --> 01:40:13,119
Ever since they parted,
he's been wandering like a madman.

2005
01:40:13,383 --> 01:40:15,052
So if he stays 10 days at my home...

2006
01:40:15,408 --> 01:40:17,142
he will leave after
realizing what our married life is like.

2007
01:40:18,082 --> 01:40:19,619
You just came here and left
them alone at your place?

2008
01:40:19,818 --> 01:40:21,186
Why are you surprised over
such a small thing, sir?

2009
01:40:21,412 --> 01:40:24,107
Her tenth-grade boyfriend last time
stayed with us for 30 days,

2010
01:40:24,237 --> 01:40:26,053
and left,
realizing I'm the only one who suits her.

2011
01:40:26,362 --> 01:40:29,236
Actually,
is your house a home or a rehab center?

2012
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:31,201
Do you provide
accommodation for everyone?

2013
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,553
Don't give compliments
in front of me, sir. I can't take it.

2014
01:40:33,786 --> 01:40:34,693
-Feeling shy?
-Yes

2015
01:40:35,466 --> 01:40:36,119
You!

2016
01:40:36,383 --> 01:40:38,152
-Slap me, it's blessing to me.
-Go!

2017
01:40:38,745 --> 01:40:39,379
Go!

2018
01:40:39,738 --> 01:40:41,197
-Sir, you are here as well?
-Hey, take the milk packet from him.

2019
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:43,840
-Happy birthday Nithya!
-Happy birthday Nithya!

2020
01:40:44,942 --> 01:40:47,416
I said no, yet you came.
Did you really need to be at this party?

2021
01:40:47,692 --> 01:40:50,099
If we don't come, Nithya and
brother bad, won't they?

2022
01:40:50,536 --> 01:40:51,691
Why are you getting so upset?

2023
01:40:51,997 --> 01:40:52,817
It's all because of you.

2024
01:40:52,908 --> 01:40:55,244
You trapped me saying
that I am getting divorce.

2025
01:40:55,783 --> 01:40:58,574
I am scared thinking how'd
Chinnu react knowing this.

2026
01:40:58,768 --> 01:41:00,167
-Hello!
-Brother-in-law.

2027
01:41:00,249 --> 01:41:01,273
-Good evening, uncle.
-Welcome, welcome.

2028
01:41:01,526 --> 01:41:02,406
-Welcome. Welcome.
-Greetings, sir

2029
01:41:02,607 --> 01:41:03,714
You are celebrating it very grandly.

2030
01:41:04,234 --> 01:41:05,036
Grand means...

2031
01:41:05,629 --> 01:41:09,244
Potato fry, Brinjal curry, Banana bajji...

2032
01:41:09,325 --> 01:41:10,126
-Wow!
-It's not like that!

2033
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:11,454
Per plate costed 1000 rupees.

2034
01:41:11,734 --> 01:41:12,284
Do you know that?

2035
01:41:13,075 --> 01:41:14,003
What? Do you mean this plate?

2036
01:41:14,333 --> 01:41:15,519
That's just a pingane@
plate, brother-in-law.

2037
01:41:15,721 --> 01:41:16,363
It's just 100 rupees.

2038
01:41:16,475 --> 01:41:18,274
-Someone has cheated you badly.
-Gautham!

2039
01:41:18,735 --> 01:41:19,505
Take your father from here.

2040
01:41:20,270 --> 01:41:22,257
He means the item on the
plate costs Rs. 1000, not just the plate.

2041
01:41:22,486 --> 01:41:23,895
-You should have told me, right?
-You didn't give chance to.

2042
01:41:24,095 --> 01:41:24,844
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

2043
01:41:25,364 --> 01:41:26,855
-Hi!
-Happy birthday Nithya.

2044
01:41:27,191 --> 01:41:28,280
-Thank you!
-Happy birthday Nithya.

2045
01:41:29,553 --> 01:41:32,902
-Chinnu, careful.
-He is giving divorce to her, right?

2046
01:41:33,347 --> 01:41:36,638
Then why are they still together?

2047
01:41:36,738 --> 01:41:37,476
So sweet!

2048
01:41:37,576 --> 01:41:39,544
I asked for a promise that
they'd stay together until the wedding.

2049
01:41:40,451 --> 01:41:41,837
-Actually...
-Sir! Sir!

2050
01:41:42,383 --> 01:41:44,703
All the items are ready,
but there is no salt in any of them, sir.

2051
01:41:45,327 --> 01:41:46,752
The bag of salt is missing, sir.

2052
01:41:47,669 --> 01:41:49,227
I know who must have done this.

2053
01:41:50,696 --> 01:41:51,623
Guna!

2054
01:41:52,576 --> 01:41:53,296
Wait!

2055
01:41:54,074 --> 01:41:55,643
-Hey! What's that?
-Nothing, sir.

2056
01:41:55,856 --> 01:41:56,539
Is it salt?

2057
01:41:56,854 --> 01:41:59,340
It's very difficult to
collect every month from your house.

2058
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:00,924
When asked, they
said, This is the salt from your house.

2059
01:42:01,137 --> 01:42:02,490
-So I thought it would be stored as stock.
-Hey!

2060
01:42:02,757 --> 01:42:05,003
If you come to the function,
please behave like a family member.

2061
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:06,978
I am behaving, sir, but you are not.

2062
01:42:07,269 --> 01:42:08,550
-What?!
-You call me family,

2063
01:42:08,756 --> 01:42:10,136
yet you didn't introduce me
to your future son-in-law.

2064
01:42:10,336 --> 01:42:11,536
-Then what kind of family member am I?
-Is that all?

2065
01:42:11,859 --> 01:42:12,472
Wait!

2066
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:14,285
Look, he is over there.

2067
01:42:14,597 --> 01:42:15,405
Gautham!

2068
01:42:20,676 --> 01:42:21,443
What's the case?

2069
01:42:22,019 --> 01:42:22,889
It's a divorce case sir.

2070
01:42:23,729 --> 01:42:25,204
Why are you opting for a divorce?

2071
01:42:25,941 --> 01:42:27,141
Because I want to get married again.

2072
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:29,345
Gautham!

2073
01:42:29,555 --> 01:42:30,888
He is Gunasekhar, my assistant.

2074
01:42:31,242 --> 01:42:32,038
He's Gautham.

2075
01:42:32,543 --> 01:42:33,552
-You keep talking...-Sir

2076
01:42:33,896 --> 01:42:35,082
I'm coming! I'll be back.

2077
01:42:35,419 --> 01:42:37,173
Hey! You are already married, aren't you?

2078
01:42:37,688 --> 01:42:40,493
Are you trying
to marry his daughter by cheating him?

2079
01:42:40,799 --> 01:42:42,499
-Wait and watch, what I'll do.
-Hello!

2080
01:42:42,778 --> 01:42:43,578
Don't overact.

2081
01:42:44,152 --> 01:42:46,487
Both your boss and Nithya are aware
of everything and they agreed.

2082
01:42:46,709 --> 01:42:47,283
I won't believe.

2083
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:49,443
-Then find out yourself.
-I'll do it.

2084
01:42:49,672 --> 01:42:51,518
-I'm his student, man.
-I'll have to handle it somehow. Dad!

2085
01:42:52,857 --> 01:42:54,226
-A small amount is enough.
-That's enough of eating. Come once.

2086
01:42:54,515 --> 01:42:55,975
-Where are you going, Goutham?
-What's the issue?

2087
01:42:56,571 --> 01:42:57,152
Sir!

2088
01:42:57,354 --> 01:42:58,947
He thinks you don't know
about the second marriage.

2089
01:42:59,333 --> 01:42:59,942
I know it, man.

2090
01:43:00,223 --> 01:43:01,954
That means you even know they're
going to court for a divorce?

2091
01:43:02,248 --> 01:43:03,524
-I know that as well.
-He knows that too.

2092
01:43:03,791 --> 01:43:04,870
Knowing everything,
how did you agree to it, sir?

2093
01:43:05,090 --> 01:43:05,872
What else can be done?

2094
01:43:06,202 --> 01:43:07,640
I took that divorce case, sir.

2095
01:43:07,865 --> 01:43:09,792
Is it? Very good.
Get it done soon.

2096
01:43:09,992 --> 01:43:11,116
-We'll get rid of this.
-Get it done soon.

2097
01:43:11,415 --> 01:43:12,377
Get it done and get rid of it.

2098
01:43:12,734 --> 01:43:15,198
Think again sir. Knowingly
sending the girl to their house...

2099
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:18,375
Hey, my daughter won't go to their home.
She will go to another home.

2100
01:43:19,204 --> 01:43:20,441
To another house?

2101
01:43:20,692 --> 01:43:21,868
Which means...
That house belongs to the girl.

2102
01:43:22,189 --> 01:43:23,277
EMI is paid by the girl.

2103
01:43:23,881 --> 01:43:27,134
If this girl is paying EMI for the house,
it's not right on that girl to stay here.

2104
01:43:27,329 --> 01:43:27,936
That's why...

2105
01:43:28,165 --> 01:43:29,454
This girl took a separate house.

2106
01:43:29,675 --> 01:43:31,480
She will pay both houses EMI.

2107
01:43:31,866 --> 01:43:36,767
If she is paying the EMI for both
the houses, what's wrong in this?

2108
01:43:37,483 --> 01:43:39,757
The real issue is the
divorce, so what are these EMIs about?

2109
01:43:40,218 --> 01:43:42,318
EMI is the problem. "Jai Balayya"!

2110
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:44,627
Happy birthday, Nithya.

2111
01:43:44,821 --> 01:43:46,079
-Thank you so much for coming.
-A small gift for you.

2112
01:43:46,357 --> 01:43:47,194
-Hope you had a good day.
-Thank you!

2113
01:44:06,095 --> 01:44:08,465
Uncle, you managed so well that even
Aunt didn't find out the divorce issue.

2114
01:44:08,549 --> 01:44:09,948
-I'm fed up with managing these issues.
-Divorce?

2115
01:44:12,151 --> 01:44:13,031
Hey, auto driver!

2116
01:44:13,917 --> 01:44:15,151
You mud-head, just stop this.

2117
01:44:15,636 --> 01:44:16,728
Are you a human or a sex machine?

2118
01:44:17,171 --> 01:44:19,014
You married her at
a very young age,

2119
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:20,581
and on top of that, got her
pregnant at rocket speed.

2120
01:44:20,827 --> 01:44:22,796
You're ready for a divorce
even before her delivery?

2121
01:44:22,913 --> 01:44:24,989
-You're such an idiot.
-Don't speak nonsense.

2122
01:44:25,817 --> 01:44:27,276
If Pallavi is thunderbolt,
I'm the thunder.

2123
01:44:27,817 --> 01:44:29,895
If Pallavi is the Sankranthi rangoli,
then I am the Gobemma in it.

2124
01:44:30,062 --> 01:44:31,518
You aren't Gobemma. You're a maniac.

2125
01:44:32,404 --> 01:44:35,126
If she is the Sankranthi rangoli, you're
the peg everyone drinks on Kanuma.

2126
01:44:35,334 --> 01:44:37,070
I'm going to light
the Bhogi fire between you two. Hey!

2127
01:44:37,189 --> 01:44:38,167
Where is the little one?

2128
01:44:38,501 --> 01:44:39,150
She's over there.

2129
01:44:39,521 --> 01:44:41,736
-Try to understand, please.
-Dear!

2130
01:44:42,581 --> 01:44:43,754
Are you
eating Manchuria? Very good, dear.

2131
01:44:44,021 --> 01:44:44,928
-Add ketchup too.
-Hey!

2132
01:44:45,214 --> 01:44:47,737
Despite marrying you, he's ready to
give you a divorce.

2133
01:44:48,038 --> 01:44:48,992
How could you love a man like him?

2134
01:44:49,405 --> 01:44:51,344
-What's this divorce all about?
-Didn't you tell her?

2135
01:44:51,596 --> 01:44:53,679
-No more divorcing.
-You married her at a very young age.

2136
01:44:54,150 --> 01:44:57,516
And you also
made her pregnant at a young age.

2137
01:44:58,027 --> 01:45:00,334
-Listen to me...
-Stop acting like a fool and say it.

2138
01:45:00,653 --> 01:45:02,102
I haven't divorced you, Chinnu.

2139
01:45:02,815 --> 01:45:04,028
Then what's this divorce about?

2140
01:45:04,643 --> 01:45:07,066
Despite being taller,
you arrived on time, dear. Let her know.

2141
01:45:07,763 --> 01:45:09,790
-He's trying to give you a divorce.
-No!

2142
01:45:10,224 --> 01:45:11,512
-No, Chinnu!
-My dad and I witnessed it.

2143
01:45:12,726 --> 01:45:13,831
Karthik, I hate you.

2144
01:45:14,193 --> 01:45:15,426
-Chinnu, I love you.
-I hate you too.

2145
01:45:15,503 --> 01:45:16,083
I hate you.

2146
01:45:16,415 --> 01:45:17,866
I'll drop you home. Let's go.

2147
01:45:18,082 --> 01:45:20,710
It is a sin to separate married couples.

2148
01:45:21,015 --> 01:45:22,282
The one who commits sin is a sinner,

2149
01:45:22,404 --> 01:45:23,695
and the one who performs virtuous
deeds is a virtuous person.

2150
01:45:23,902 --> 01:45:26,119
He who atones for his
sins is a great soul.

2151
01:45:26,478 --> 01:45:27,089
Let's go, dear.

2152
01:45:27,185 --> 01:45:28,582
Chinnu!

2153
01:45:35,657 --> 01:45:39,884
[music mutes voices]

2154
01:45:41,610 --> 01:45:42,714
We would have been caught.

2155
01:45:44,146 --> 01:45:44,993
-What?
-Turn around.

2156
01:45:46,321 --> 01:45:47,338
Hey! Birthday girl.

2157
01:45:47,632 --> 01:45:48,974
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

2158
01:45:51,064 --> 01:45:52,966
-What truth are you speaking about?
-Madam told me everything.

2159
01:45:53,846 --> 01:45:54,632
What did she say?

2160
01:45:54,863 --> 01:45:56,475
-Why did you hide the truth from me?
-What's that?

2161
01:45:57,989 --> 01:45:58,837
You and ma'am...

2162
01:46:00,052 --> 01:46:01,028
Are friends from your graduation days.

2163
01:46:04,158 --> 01:46:04,890
It's true. We are friends.

2164
01:46:05,930 --> 01:46:06,823
Why didn't you tell me?

2165
01:46:07,389 --> 01:46:09,245
It's not a friendship
worth boasting about.

2166
01:46:09,574 --> 01:46:11,566
She belongs to
"friends without benefits".

2167
01:46:11,841 --> 01:46:14,311
-It's not worth sharing about.
-Is it?

2168
01:46:14,952 --> 01:46:16,916
Did you tell about that?

2169
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:17,783
About what?

2170
01:46:18,062 --> 01:46:21,367
-In your college--
-Yeah, in our college--

2171
01:46:21,579 --> 01:46:23,077
-In your college--
-Err...

2172
01:46:23,277 --> 01:46:24,645
-Your love story.
-Hey!

2173
01:46:25,098 --> 01:46:26,588
Love? What about it?

2174
01:46:27,118 --> 01:46:27,829
Who's that girl?

2175
01:46:28,612 --> 01:46:30,547
Oh!

2176
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,941
She? She's a sadistic psychopath.

2177
01:46:34,807 --> 01:46:36,532
She is like a vamp in
The Vampire Diaries.

2178
01:46:36,774 --> 01:46:38,813
She writes about how to
torture people in a book.

2179
01:46:39,369 --> 01:46:41,323
She's married, so she can be
happy with her husband, right?

2180
01:46:42,542 --> 01:46:44,278
She appears occasionally
and tortures me like this.

2181
01:46:44,582 --> 01:46:47,880
When I talk about her,
I get negative vibes.

2182
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:48,895
That's why I didn't tell you D--

2183
01:46:48,987 --> 01:46:50,131
-What?
-Nithya...

2184
01:46:50,358 --> 01:46:52,195
Then why did you say
that I'm your first love.

2185
01:46:53,007 --> 01:46:54,341
Did he tell that you're his first love?

2186
01:46:55,571 --> 01:46:57,028
Gautham, you shouldn't say that,
should you?

2187
01:46:57,194 --> 01:46:59,121
We should not lie to those who trust us.

2188
01:46:59,237 --> 01:46:59,857
Yes!

2189
01:47:00,097 --> 01:47:01,299
-This is very wrong.
-Very wrong.

2190
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:04,100
-Don't start a relationship with a lie.
-Don't start.

2191
01:47:04,241 --> 01:47:05,399
You didn't hide it, right?

2192
01:47:06,233 --> 01:47:07,430
-You didn't hide, right?
-No!

2193
01:47:08,602 --> 01:47:09,409
Hey!

2194
01:47:10,674 --> 01:47:12,302
-You didn't hide, right?
-I'll handle you myself.

2195
01:47:14,978 --> 01:47:15,765
God!

2196
01:47:16,414 --> 01:47:17,134
Madam!

2197
01:47:20,721 --> 01:47:21,341
Hey!

2198
01:47:21,787 --> 01:47:23,309
Why is ma'am offended
and leaving the place?

2199
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:25,202
She came to know about his first love.

2200
01:47:25,465 --> 01:47:27,827
Some get upset over a first
marriage or first divorce.

2201
01:47:27,985 --> 01:47:29,286
She walked away over her first love.

2202
01:47:29,493 --> 01:47:30,541
All women are like that, brother.

2203
01:47:30,701 --> 01:47:32,751
We don't know what upsets
them or what they fight over.

2204
01:47:32,897 --> 01:47:34,079
-That's true!
-Recently, after watching Girlfriend Film,

2205
01:47:34,296 --> 01:47:36,184
when a girl was asked to overcome her
fear, she let go of her dupatta instead.

2206
01:47:37,033 --> 01:47:39,074
However, do you know what
misunderstanding is called in English?

2207
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:40,495
It's called a "Miss" understanding.

2208
01:47:40,721 --> 01:47:42,092
They don't call it "Mister" understanding,
right?

2209
01:47:42,261 --> 01:47:43,079
Miss and Mister!

2210
01:47:43,505 --> 01:47:44,843
Stop watching SKN speeches.

2211
01:47:46,062 --> 01:47:47,389
I think he didn't understand it.

2212
01:47:49,068 --> 01:47:50,048
First love?

2213
01:47:53,667 --> 01:47:54,780
Don't feed sad, dude.

2214
01:47:55,226 --> 01:47:57,013
It's said that marrying
with many lies isn't wrong.

2215
01:47:57,448 --> 01:48:01,115
You told just one lie:
that you're not married.

2216
01:48:03,202 --> 01:48:04,562
Why does everything
bad happen only to me?

2217
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:08,750
I'm already suffering with one wife.

2218
01:48:09,256 --> 01:48:11,176
Now I'm suffering
between two wives.

2219
01:48:19,268 --> 01:48:20,921
They're making my life hell.

2220
01:48:25,096 --> 01:48:27,142
Hey, it's raw. It's hard.

2221
01:48:47,883 --> 01:48:53,134
"Stuck between two fine women!"

2222
01:48:56,805 --> 01:49:03,721
"Both tormenting from both sides"

2223
01:49:05,093 --> 01:49:09,227
"Both are two odd cases."

2224
01:49:09,385 --> 01:49:12,865
"Now it has come to risking my wedding!"

2225
01:49:13,822 --> 01:49:15,482
"I'm caught!"

2226
01:49:16,572 --> 01:49:19,899
"I've been crushed badly."

2227
01:49:20,614 --> 01:49:22,454
"My life is lost!"

2228
01:49:22,619 --> 01:49:24,219
"I'm torn!"

2229
01:49:24,988 --> 01:49:28,474
"My bad time has started!"

2230
01:49:29,689 --> 01:49:31,216
"I'm stuck!"

2231
01:49:59,977 --> 01:50:04,211
"I'm a riddle without an answer."

2232
01:50:06,572 --> 01:50:12,792
"God know till when this game continues!"

2233
01:50:14,977 --> 01:50:18,850
"Life has become a football."

2234
01:50:19,484 --> 01:50:23,011
"Fate has played foul with me."

2235
01:50:23,176 --> 01:50:27,223
"WHy does this happen to me?"

2236
01:50:27,491 --> 01:50:31,795
"Dirty things happening on both sides."

2237
01:51:07,824 --> 01:51:13,662
"Why did so many hassles
surround my wedding?"

2238
01:51:16,713 --> 01:51:22,707
"Why is this suffocation troubling me?"

2239
01:51:24,851 --> 01:51:28,865
"I'd probably become a monk."

2240
01:51:29,428 --> 01:51:32,741
"Or do I run away from this place?"

2241
01:51:32,958 --> 01:51:39,441
"No alcohol can douse this fire."

2242
01:51:40,108 --> 01:51:41,801
"My heart is burning."

2243
01:51:42,584 --> 01:51:44,355
"I'm caught!"

2244
01:51:44,833 --> 01:51:48,372
"I've been crushed badly."

2245
01:51:49,249 --> 01:51:50,999
"My life is lost!"

2246
01:51:51,175 --> 01:51:52,972
"I'm torn!"

2247
01:51:53,544 --> 01:51:55,646
"My bad time has started!"

2248
01:51:55,792 --> 01:51:59,445
"I'm stuck!"

2249
01:52:07,195 --> 01:52:08,242
-Dude!
-Hmm!

2250
01:52:08,455 --> 01:52:10,049
If a relationship fails,
we ourselves can't bear it.

2251
01:52:10,503 --> 01:52:13,670
What is your father doing now,
after your aunt left him at this age?

2252
01:52:14,711 --> 01:52:16,586
Yes... let's see how that goes.

2253
01:52:18,812 --> 01:52:23,688
[doing reel for a song]

2254
01:52:29,935 --> 01:52:31,478
Dad! Dad!

2255
01:52:31,669 --> 01:52:32,586
Are you happy now?

2256
01:52:32,878 --> 01:52:35,128
Look, without a woman to
light the lamp in the house,

2257
01:52:35,239 --> 01:52:36,614
see how dark the house has become.

2258
01:52:37,094 --> 01:52:37,781
Look!

2259
01:52:38,951 --> 01:52:40,780
If you weren't so stubborn, you could
just turn on the lights, couldn't you?

2260
01:52:41,116 --> 01:52:44,002
Is simply turning on the lights enough?
The whole house feels empty.

2261
01:52:44,539 --> 01:52:45,589
The bedroom is covered in cobwebs.

2262
01:52:45,966 --> 01:52:47,729
-This bed--
-Please stop it, uncle.

2263
01:52:47,997 --> 01:52:49,144
I stopped it a long time ago, didn't I?

2264
01:52:49,352 --> 01:52:50,892
But with your glamour and skill,

2265
01:52:51,164 --> 01:52:52,769
you could easily win over another
girl in a week, couldn't you?

2266
01:52:52,946 --> 01:52:53,672
Shut up!

2267
01:52:54,108 --> 01:52:55,192
Chinnu means life to me.

2268
01:52:55,717 --> 01:52:56,483
I know it, uncle.

2269
01:52:56,765 --> 01:52:59,939
But if you remarry without a divorce,
the law will put you behind bars.

2270
01:53:00,153 --> 01:53:01,212
It's not that easy.

2271
01:53:02,157 --> 01:53:02,951
What did you say?

2272
01:53:03,335 --> 01:53:03,978
Yeah.

2273
01:53:04,297 --> 01:53:06,745
In this same case, my friend Venu
Swamy went to jail for two years.

2274
01:53:09,477 --> 01:53:10,222
Dad!

2275
01:53:10,707 --> 01:53:12,274
Looks like he's come
up with a new plan.

2276
01:53:13,844 --> 01:53:14,524
Feed some water to that plant.

2277
01:53:14,844 --> 01:53:15,886
-Over here as well.
-Greetings to you, Aunty.

2278
01:53:16,094 --> 01:53:16,911
Who are you?

2279
01:53:17,133 --> 01:53:18,591
-What is your relationship to Diya?
-Aunt.

2280
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:19,776
You are aunt to me as well.

2281
01:53:20,219 --> 01:53:21,844
What do you make better? Coffee or tea?

2282
01:53:22,032 --> 01:53:22,818
I do none.

2283
01:53:23,413 --> 01:53:25,070
-You...
-You...

2284
01:53:25,517 --> 01:53:26,886
-Are you Diya's uncle?
-Yeah, that's right.

2285
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:28,114
So you are uncle to me as well.

2286
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:29,912
What do you make better? Coffee or tea?

2287
01:53:29,974 --> 01:53:31,713
-Coffee for sure.
-Can I get some coffee, please?

2288
01:53:32,465 --> 01:53:33,699
Uncle, were you here?

2289
01:53:33,885 --> 01:53:34,791
What a coincidence!

2290
01:53:34,919 --> 01:53:37,154
-What are you doing here?
-Who is this guy, brother?

2291
01:53:38,056 --> 01:53:39,440
He's addressing you with a relationship.

2292
01:53:39,749 --> 01:53:40,925
-Tell them.
-He is our relative.

2293
01:53:41,121 --> 01:53:43,301
-From the college days.
-A distant relative.

2294
01:53:43,490 --> 01:53:46,560
-We used to have fun.
-Casual or serious fun?

2295
01:53:46,830 --> 01:53:47,892
-That is--
-Brother-in-law...

2296
01:53:48,659 --> 01:53:50,159
Is it that important?

2297
01:53:50,439 --> 01:53:51,647
Can you please give us some space?

2298
01:53:51,793 --> 01:53:54,220
-He wanted to know. Let me clarify.
-You come this way. Let's go!

2299
01:53:54,571 --> 01:53:55,696
Let me tell--

2300
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:58,417
Hey!

2301
01:53:58,652 --> 01:54:01,152
My daughter is married and happy.

2302
01:54:01,302 --> 01:54:04,593
If you disturb her life,
I'll have you thrown in jail.

2303
01:54:04,918 --> 01:54:07,091
I'm here to send
both you and your daughter to jail.

2304
01:54:08,268 --> 01:54:09,143
Look!

2305
01:54:11,980 --> 01:54:13,313
Are you wondering what it is?

2306
01:54:14,112 --> 01:54:15,071
It's a marriage certificate.

2307
01:54:16,058 --> 01:54:17,600
Will you call your daughter now?

2308
01:54:29,805 --> 01:54:30,673
Diya...

2309
01:54:36,147 --> 01:54:37,438
Why are you here?

2310
01:54:37,849 --> 01:54:39,146
I have come to take your daughter.

2311
01:54:39,354 --> 01:54:40,438
She's refusing to divorce me, Uncle.

2312
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:42,831
Getting married without obtaining
a divorce is a legal offense.

2313
01:54:43,090 --> 01:54:44,734
According to section A, B, C...

2314
01:54:45,121 --> 01:54:46,159
your daughter for marrying...

2315
01:54:46,359 --> 01:54:47,206
and you for getting her married...

2316
01:54:47,422 --> 01:54:48,949
both of you will be jailed.

2317
01:54:49,304 --> 01:54:51,513
My daughter won't step into court.

2318
01:54:51,719 --> 01:54:53,269
No need.
There aren't any stairs to climb.

2319
01:54:53,505 --> 01:54:54,546
What will you do if I don't come?

2320
01:54:54,852 --> 01:54:56,704
What's there to worry about?
I'll request your husband.

2321
01:54:56,905 --> 01:54:58,081
-Brother!
-Hey! Wait!

2322
01:54:58,348 --> 01:54:59,645
We are discussing it, aren't we?

2323
01:54:59,965 --> 01:55:01,153
Why are you getting worried?

2324
01:55:01,522 --> 01:55:02,719
So, you didn't tell your
husband about this?

2325
01:55:03,142 --> 01:55:04,934
This one thing is enough
to cause an uproar.

2326
01:55:05,134 --> 01:55:05,595
-Brother!
-Hey!

2327
01:55:05,822 --> 01:55:06,764
-Brother!
-Wait!

2328
01:55:07,107 --> 01:55:08,023
I'll attend the court.

2329
01:55:08,571 --> 01:55:09,396
I will bring her.

2330
01:55:09,730 --> 01:55:10,605
Very good!

2331
01:55:11,026 --> 01:55:13,485
We're meeting family lawyer Gunasekhar
at ten o'clock in the morning

2332
01:55:14,229 --> 01:55:15,645
Everyone calls him Vakeel Saab.

2333
01:55:15,832 --> 01:55:16,749
Come.

2334
01:55:19,522 --> 01:55:21,557
Excuse me, Mr. Gunasekhar,
I've brought her.

2335
01:55:21,794 --> 01:55:22,588
-Oh!
-Come, dear!

2336
01:55:23,267 --> 01:55:24,509
-Did you come?
-Yeah. We're here.

2337
01:55:24,907 --> 01:55:26,540
-I'm glad your father didn't come.
-Greetings, sir.

2338
01:55:29,383 --> 01:55:30,217
Anyways!

2339
01:55:32,883 --> 01:55:36,125
If you want a divorce,
I need to know why you are separating.

2340
01:55:38,884 --> 01:55:40,477
-You tell him.
-You tell him.

2341
01:55:40,757 --> 01:55:42,992
There's no background score when
two people look at each other...

2342
01:55:43,128 --> 01:55:45,658
and no flashback unfolds for me.

2343
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:46,450
You've to tell me.

2344
01:55:46,604 --> 01:55:48,030
He didn't apologize to my dad, sir.

2345
01:55:48,277 --> 01:55:49,719
What?
You broke up because he didn't say sorry.

2346
01:55:49,983 --> 01:55:50,579
Yes, sir.

2347
01:55:50,764 --> 01:55:51,729
Why did you demand an
apology in the first place?

2348
01:55:51,891 --> 01:55:53,600
He used my washroom.

2349
01:55:53,842 --> 01:55:55,021
So filthy.

2350
01:55:56,097 --> 01:55:57,252
Why did you use his washroom?

2351
01:55:57,379 --> 01:55:59,805
This gentleman embezzled the money instead
of building toilets for the students.

2352
01:55:59,994 --> 01:56:02,080
What do you mean I stole the money?
Don't talk nonsense.

2353
01:56:02,184 --> 01:56:03,434
Did you buy the car
without stealing the money?

2354
01:56:03,513 --> 01:56:04,347
That is my hard-earned money.

2355
01:56:04,545 --> 01:56:05,457
Do you really work hard?

2356
01:56:05,543 --> 01:56:06,584
-Don't talk as if you know everything.
-Hey!

2357
01:56:08,267 --> 01:56:10,044
If they both use one brain
instead of sharing one washroom,

2358
01:56:10,202 --> 01:56:11,212
a solution will emerge.

2359
01:56:13,283 --> 01:56:14,138
You can't bear a child.

2360
01:56:15,752 --> 01:56:16,941
You are very fond of children.

2361
01:56:17,055 --> 01:56:17,661
Okay!

2362
01:56:17,842 --> 01:56:20,663
You've been trying to
conceive for seven long years.

2363
01:56:21,226 --> 01:56:22,183
But you're unable to.

2364
01:56:22,764 --> 01:56:24,097
That's why they are getting a divorce.

2365
01:56:24,345 --> 01:56:25,020
It's clear.

2366
01:56:25,296 --> 01:56:26,719
-That's my vision.
-Sir, it's fantastic.

2367
01:56:26,830 --> 01:56:27,657
-Mention it exactly the same.
-Diya...

2368
01:56:28,868 --> 01:56:29,771
What happened to her?

2369
01:56:29,881 --> 01:56:30,575
Is the chair not good?

2370
01:56:30,948 --> 01:56:32,656
In fact, the girl cannot conceive.

2371
01:56:33,143 --> 01:56:34,602
I'm so sorry. I didn't know about that.

2372
01:56:35,235 --> 01:56:37,151
I'm sorry for being insensitive.
I'm really sorry.

2373
01:56:43,436 --> 01:56:44,311
Sir!

2374
01:56:44,518 --> 01:56:45,748
Please attribute the problem of not
being able to have children to me,

2375
01:56:45,843 --> 01:56:46,929
and process the application, sir.

2376
01:56:48,943 --> 01:56:50,950
Sympathy is good in such situations.

2377
01:56:51,408 --> 01:56:52,951
But a medical certificate is
also required to establish it.

2378
01:56:53,218 --> 01:56:56,228
If you send me your address on WhatsApp,
I will get the certificate delivered.

2379
01:56:56,528 --> 01:56:57,534
Let's submit to the court.

2380
01:56:57,694 --> 01:56:58,527
Okay!

2381
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:03,458
Why are you crying?

2382
01:57:04,068 --> 01:57:05,541
I'll give it in writing that I'm
the reason she can't have children.

2383
01:57:06,276 --> 01:57:08,276
These days,
many advanced technologies have emerged.

2384
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:10,573
Not having children is
not a problem at all.

2385
01:57:14,438 --> 01:57:15,671
Hey! Look at me.

2386
01:57:15,951 --> 01:57:17,604
You will soon be called 'Mom'.

2387
01:57:19,101 --> 01:57:21,268
God is taking a little time
to give you what you want.

2388
01:57:21,774 --> 01:57:23,191
That's when its value will be understood.

2389
01:57:24,891 --> 01:57:26,725
He gave you a good husband in life.

2390
01:57:27,719 --> 01:57:28,927
He also gives good children.

2391
01:57:31,748 --> 01:57:32,405
Take care!

2392
01:57:43,892 --> 01:57:49,207
I think he has a habit of admitting
it's his fault even when it's not.

2393
01:57:51,519 --> 01:57:56,794
He didn't leave because
of himself or his ego.

2394
01:57:59,473 --> 01:58:00,369
My ego has fallen between you both.

2395
01:58:06,119 --> 01:58:08,170
Among thousands of students

2396
01:58:08,302 --> 01:58:10,247
in the college,
I couldn't accept you as one of them.

2397
01:58:11,143 --> 01:58:15,507
How can I accept you as my
son-in-law under such circumstances?

2398
01:58:16,822 --> 01:58:18,291
Leave my daughter alone.

2399
01:58:18,727 --> 01:58:20,726
Will you debar me if I don't let go?

2400
01:58:21,251 --> 01:58:22,876
Will you write 'bad'
on the conduct certificate?

2401
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:24,367
Will you fail me in the practical exams?

2402
01:58:24,827 --> 01:58:26,393
Do whatever you want to do.

2403
01:58:26,798 --> 01:58:27,691
I won't do any of that.

2404
01:58:28,661 --> 01:58:32,327
If I see you with my daughter again...

2405
01:58:33,336 --> 01:58:34,794
I'll commit suicide.

2406
01:58:35,810 --> 01:58:37,685
You know very well about my ego,
don't you?

2407
01:58:37,902 --> 01:58:38,868
Are you blackmailing me?

2408
01:58:39,736 --> 01:58:40,861
Go ahead and do it.

2409
01:58:43,429 --> 01:58:45,856
Gautham, my father met with an accident.

2410
01:58:49,076 --> 01:58:51,065
I want to talk to the
Gautham once.

2411
01:58:52,209 --> 01:58:53,209
Please go out.

2412
01:58:58,886 --> 01:59:00,677
Do you think this was an accident?

2413
01:59:00,997 --> 01:59:01,697
No!

2414
01:59:02,964 --> 01:59:04,797
I tried to commit suicide.

2415
01:59:05,219 --> 01:59:06,038
But it failed.

2416
01:59:07,761 --> 01:59:08,799
I won't fail next time.

2417
01:59:09,046 --> 01:59:09,921
What are you talking about?

2418
01:59:10,175 --> 01:59:10,907
Are you mad?

2419
01:59:11,119 --> 01:59:13,717
I won't like you in
this life or the next.

2420
01:59:14,716 --> 01:59:16,406
After I die, you two be happy.

2421
01:59:16,688 --> 01:59:17,771
You don't have to die.

2422
01:59:19,086 --> 01:59:20,836
I will leave. Be happy.

2423
01:59:23,536 --> 01:59:24,702
Hey! What is he saying?

2424
01:59:24,859 --> 01:59:25,929
He's saying he's going to die.

2425
01:59:27,263 --> 01:59:28,786
This might appear to be
suicide to the all.

2426
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,689
But in my opinion, I think I killed him.

2427
01:59:35,062 --> 01:59:36,686
I cannot live with that guilt
for the rest of my life.

2428
01:59:40,810 --> 01:59:44,268
If he suddenly leaves you one day,
you won't believe it.

2429
01:59:45,497 --> 01:59:47,581
He planned it himself to apologize...

2430
01:59:47,969 --> 01:59:51,877
he made himself look bad to you
and ruined his image in your eyes.

2431
01:59:52,397 --> 01:59:55,147
I feel safer being with my
father than being with you.

2432
01:59:57,157 --> 01:59:59,561
I didn't know then that
he was such a good person.

2433
02:00:02,514 --> 02:00:03,847
I'm sorry, dear.

2434
02:00:07,145 --> 02:00:12,620
Now, the responsibility of setting
up his life rests with you and me.

2435
02:00:18,802 --> 02:00:20,468
Where is chinnu, uncle?

2436
02:00:20,698 --> 02:00:21,615
She said she won't be with you.

2437
02:00:21,867 --> 02:00:23,498
She asked to bring all her belongings.

2438
02:00:23,925 --> 02:00:26,590
Go and bring everything
else that belongs to her.

2439
02:00:26,685 --> 02:00:29,336
Please think about the unborn child,
mother-in-law.

2440
02:00:30,092 --> 02:00:30,934
What's your age?

2441
02:00:31,567 --> 02:00:32,567
What's your age?

2442
02:00:33,077 --> 02:00:33,918
It's just 59.

2443
02:00:34,448 --> 02:00:36,721
You are 59 and I'm 50.

2444
02:00:37,001 --> 02:00:40,376
What kind of fate is this,
that you would come and call me 'aunt'?

2445
02:00:40,774 --> 02:00:43,982
I prayed to a million gods for
you and my daughter to part ways.

2446
02:00:44,411 --> 02:00:45,201
Forgive me, mother-in-law.

2447
02:00:45,392 --> 02:00:47,834
I used those abusive words
out of my love for Chinnu.

2448
02:00:48,194 --> 02:00:49,308
Please forgive me.

2449
02:00:49,465 --> 02:00:51,391
-Excuse me, this man is also mad.
-Please forgive me.

2450
02:00:51,477 --> 02:00:53,311
-He's a psycho idiot. Come on, let's go.
-Don't make us part ways.

2451
02:00:55,786 --> 02:00:57,142
-What happened?
-Mother-in-law. Father-in-law.

2452
02:00:57,474 --> 02:00:59,412
-Hey! Please tell them.
-Grandma.

2453
02:00:59,577 --> 02:01:00,286
-Grandpa.
-Son!

2454
02:01:00,644 --> 02:01:01,879
Can you talk without bringing
relationships into this?

2455
02:01:01,986 --> 02:01:02,599
Okay!

2456
02:01:02,685 --> 02:01:03,695
What you don't know is...

2457
02:01:03,781 --> 02:01:05,085
-It is true that we went to court.
-Yeah!

2458
02:01:05,218 --> 02:01:06,468
It is true that we have
applied for a divorce.

2459
02:01:06,599 --> 02:01:07,943
What is unknown is that...

2460
02:01:08,193 --> 02:01:09,234
Those divorce papers

2461
02:01:09,414 --> 02:01:11,456
-and my dad--
-And your dad...

2462
02:01:12,239 --> 02:01:13,221
Tell me what happened.

2463
02:01:14,043 --> 02:01:15,751
My dad--

2464
02:01:17,491 --> 02:01:19,286
My father thinking
of applying for a divorce.

2465
02:01:19,782 --> 02:01:21,052
What's wrong with that?

2466
02:01:22,642 --> 02:01:24,892
Your father is not the one
giving my daughter a divorce.

2467
02:01:25,193 --> 02:01:27,114
My daughter is divorcing your father.

2468
02:01:27,329 --> 02:01:29,043
-We'll meet again at the court.
-Okay! Go!

2469
02:01:29,182 --> 02:01:30,242
Will surely meet.

2470
02:01:37,335 --> 02:01:40,536
It looks like they're taking
all her belongings with them.

2471
02:01:40,723 --> 02:01:42,296
-Just for fun.
-Good!

2472
02:01:42,508 --> 02:01:45,828
Sometimes, it takes a lifetime to
realize someone made a mistake.

2473
02:01:46,155 --> 02:01:47,687
-Why did you come at this time?
-Dad!

2474
02:01:49,371 --> 02:01:50,288
What made you come this way, Nithya?

2475
02:01:50,544 --> 02:01:52,419
I thought about what you said, Gautham.

2476
02:01:52,894 --> 02:01:55,186
Marriage is not just
about two signatures.

2477
02:01:55,630 --> 02:01:56,672
A load of memories.

2478
02:01:57,650 --> 02:01:58,775
You must tie the sacred thread

2479
02:01:59,135 --> 02:02:00,260
and put the toe rings on me.

2480
02:02:00,986 --> 02:02:02,903
We both should get married
wearing silk clothes.

2481
02:02:03,383 --> 02:02:04,758
Did you move the wedding

2482
02:02:04,873 --> 02:02:06,530
-to a marriage hall now?
-Marriage...

2483
02:02:06,865 --> 02:02:08,198
will happen at the register office only.

2484
02:02:08,623 --> 02:02:10,087
Dad spoke to the registrar.

2485
02:02:10,475 --> 02:02:11,717
We can do it the way
we planned even there.

2486
02:02:12,337 --> 02:02:13,254
Are you happy now?

2487
02:02:13,672 --> 02:02:16,537
-Yeah. I'm happy.
-Tomorrow, we'll head for shopping.

2488
02:02:16,849 --> 02:02:18,599
-Dude, we received the report.
-Hey!

2489
02:02:20,107 --> 02:02:21,107
What's that?

2490
02:02:22,345 --> 02:02:23,220
What's that!

2491
02:02:23,966 --> 02:02:25,755
-It's a corona certificate, uncle.
-Corona?

2492
02:02:26,060 --> 02:02:27,976
Where is Corona now?

2493
02:02:29,331 --> 02:02:32,139
Why is everyone so tense?

2494
02:02:33,145 --> 02:02:34,522
Hey! What's that?

2495
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:36,048
Fertility--

2496
02:02:37,807 --> 02:02:39,307
Whether they can have children at all.

2497
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:41,647
What's there in that?

2498
02:02:42,046 --> 02:02:43,046
Uncle, it says they won't be born.

2499
02:02:44,775 --> 02:02:45,733
Whose report is that?

2500
02:02:48,854 --> 02:02:50,794
I've already proved it.

2501
02:03:00,462 --> 02:03:02,545
Did you see it? 100 percent.

2502
02:03:03,055 --> 02:03:05,638
The report said that he would
not be able to have children.

2503
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:09,159
-That's his report.
-Why did you get it done?

2504
02:03:10,085 --> 02:03:11,544
What was the need to get it done?

2505
02:03:12,392 --> 02:03:14,720
I've seen in reels that once
you're past 30, the chances drop.

2506
02:03:15,343 --> 02:03:17,458
This is what happened
when I did it for safety.

2507
02:03:18,068 --> 02:03:20,276
Now that you know they won't be born,
what will you do?

2508
02:03:26,885 --> 02:03:29,114
Gautham, don't feel bad.

2509
02:03:30,660 --> 02:03:32,704
Certificates like these
cannot separate us.

2510
02:03:34,607 --> 02:03:35,767
I loved you.

2511
02:03:37,845 --> 02:03:39,395
Not for the kids who could
be born to us someday.

2512
02:03:40,211 --> 02:03:42,669
That's not the point, dear. What if
you don't have children in the future?

2513
02:03:42,735 --> 02:03:44,527
We'll adopt, Dad. It's not a big issue.

2514
02:03:45,627 --> 02:03:48,035
But how many people get tested
like this before marriage?

2515
02:03:49,215 --> 02:03:50,993
How many people are
as genuine as Gautham?

2516
02:03:51,642 --> 02:03:53,171
If we like someone,

2517
02:03:53,980 --> 02:03:56,063
It's just not about
their likes and tastes,

2518
02:03:59,065 --> 02:04:00,647
You should love their flaws too.

2519
02:04:02,845 --> 02:04:03,762
It's okay.

2520
02:04:08,362 --> 02:04:09,180
Dude...

2521
02:04:09,358 --> 02:04:12,768
She is ready to marry you even
after you said you can't have kids.

2522
02:04:13,235 --> 02:04:14,147
She is a very good girl.

2523
02:04:14,428 --> 02:04:16,234
Do whatever it takes but don't lose her.

2524
02:04:16,598 --> 02:04:19,636
If you can manage these two days without
disclosing your past love and divorce...

2525
02:04:19,859 --> 02:04:20,767
your life would be happy.

2526
02:04:29,277 --> 02:04:31,017
[phone ringing]

2527
02:04:31,623 --> 02:04:32,610
Who is it at this time?

2528
02:04:34,263 --> 02:04:35,737
-Yeah, tell me.-Hey, Gautam.

2529
02:04:36,037 --> 02:04:37,117
Your wedding day is just two days away!

2530
02:04:37,552 --> 02:04:40,927
The wedding's at 11 a.m. I need
the divorce papers before that.

2531
02:04:41,847 --> 02:04:43,973
Okay. I got stuck with this guy.

2532
02:04:44,233 --> 02:04:47,059
[phone ringing]

2533
02:04:49,506 --> 02:04:50,648
Yeah, tell me.

2534
02:04:51,148 --> 02:04:53,769
The divorce case hearing is set for
10 a.m., day after tomorrow. Be ready!

2535
02:04:54,172 --> 02:04:55,046
Okay.

2536
02:04:55,653 --> 02:04:58,479
[phone ringing]

2537
02:05:00,797 --> 02:05:04,025
-Hello.
-This is Pallavi's lawyer.

2538
02:05:04,299 --> 02:05:08,299
Your divorce hearing is at 9:30 a.m.
the day after tomorrow. So be in court.

2539
02:05:11,371 --> 02:05:13,538
I've seen fathers and sons
taking exams together.

2540
02:05:14,093 --> 02:05:15,869
I've even seen them
boozing together at a bar.

2541
02:05:16,119 --> 02:05:19,160
First time seeing both of them go
to court together for a divorce.

2542
02:05:19,590 --> 02:05:22,230
Let everyone live happily,
except these two.

2543
02:05:22,755 --> 02:05:23,442
Damn it!

2544
02:05:24,851 --> 02:05:26,864
Dad, we're running late. Are you ready?

2545
02:05:27,070 --> 02:05:29,037
I am ready. Come soon.

2546
02:05:30,715 --> 02:05:34,090
Sir, I have found a stronger
reason to stop this marriage.

2547
02:05:34,695 --> 02:05:36,731
-What is it?
-I have enquired about love,

2548
02:05:37,006 --> 02:05:38,417
I found out that he's
already married, sir.

2549
02:05:39,177 --> 02:05:41,510
He has already had a registered marriage,
sir. That girl is none other than,

2550
02:05:42,234 --> 02:05:43,120
his madam Diya.

2551
02:05:46,085 --> 02:05:48,943
That's exactly why he freaks out
about the Registrar's Office.

2552
02:05:49,275 --> 02:05:50,018
Yes sir.

2553
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:52,377
[phone ringing]

2554
02:05:54,383 --> 02:05:55,037
Hello?

2555
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:57,841
Sir, as per your instructions, I'm
arranging the divorce for your son-in-law.

2556
02:05:58,599 --> 02:06:00,005
-With Diya, right?
-Yes, sir.

2557
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:02,322
-Okay. Do it! Do it.
-I didn't accept the fee, sir, I promise.

2558
02:06:02,510 --> 02:06:03,130
Okay!

2559
02:06:09,173 --> 02:06:10,185
Nitya...

2560
02:06:12,395 --> 02:06:15,989
I told you he wasn't right for
you but you didn't listen to me.

2561
02:06:17,726 --> 02:06:19,455
He concealed such
an important matter.

2562
02:06:20,696 --> 02:06:22,164
He dragged it all the way to a wedding.

2563
02:06:24,110 --> 02:06:27,017
Nithya, what should we
do about him? Tell me.

2564
02:06:30,129 --> 02:06:32,960
-Let's go to the register office, dad.
-What?

2565
02:06:33,893 --> 02:06:37,339
I want to see how
badly he's cheating me.

2566
02:06:38,377 --> 02:06:39,151
Correct!

2567
02:06:39,958 --> 02:06:40,813
Good girl!

2568
02:06:43,451 --> 02:06:45,301
Listen to me one last
time, please, Chinnu.

2569
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:46,453
Please!

2570
02:06:46,891 --> 02:06:48,514
Mother-in-law, at least
try explaining to her.

2571
02:06:49,129 --> 02:06:51,610
A mother's supposed to hold the
family together, not break it.

2572
02:06:51,797 --> 02:06:55,255
You try standing for half an hour.
Then we'll talk about your marriage.

2573
02:06:55,702 --> 02:06:58,330
Mother-in-law, if you want,
test how much I love her.

2574
02:06:58,504 --> 02:06:59,442
But what are these fitness tests

2575
02:06:59,592 --> 02:07:01,701
Case 420. Karthik!

2576
02:07:02,189 --> 02:07:03,834
-Pallavi...
-Get up

2577
02:07:04,456 --> 02:07:06,536
-Chinnu, careful.
-Leave me.

2578
02:07:08,952 --> 02:07:11,077
-Where is your husband?
-It's me, sir.

2579
02:07:12,171 --> 02:07:12,878
Take your hand off me.

2580
02:07:14,302 --> 02:07:15,636
-Divorce Sanction.
-Sir...

2581
02:07:15,886 --> 02:07:17,869
Without even knowing the reason,
how can there be a divorce, sir?

2582
02:07:18,054 --> 02:07:18,884
I can see it!

2583
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:21,420
She's realised her mistake.
Why look for more reasons?

2584
02:07:21,773 --> 02:07:22,898
Confirm! divorce!

2585
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:24,423
-Next!
-Thank you, sir.

2586
02:07:24,638 --> 02:07:26,048
-Sir... sir! Two minutes, sir.
-Why?

2587
02:07:26,214 --> 02:07:26,978
-Pallavi
-What is it?

2588
02:07:27,129 --> 02:07:29,299
Do you know why it's called 'marriage'
in English?

2589
02:07:29,531 --> 02:07:32,198
There's no age limit for getting married.
Marriage isn't restricted to one age.

2590
02:07:32,338 --> 02:07:33,666
Oh, we were not aware of this.

2591
02:07:33,928 --> 02:07:35,220
-Thank you, sir.
-One minute.

2592
02:07:36,248 --> 02:07:38,239
I'm not the one who gave you that notice.

2593
02:07:38,772 --> 02:07:40,771
Gautam gave it to the first
woman he got married to.

2594
02:07:41,111 --> 02:07:43,349
He used my name so his
father-in-law wouldn't find out.

2595
02:07:43,944 --> 02:07:47,444
This lie has crossed every limit.
What are you waiting for? Speak up.

2596
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:50,879
Yes, we didn't know how to manage
it that day so all this happened.

2597
02:07:52,082 --> 02:07:52,875
Okay!

2598
02:07:53,572 --> 02:07:55,188
If you still don't believe me,

2599
02:07:55,512 --> 02:07:58,262
-I'll prove it to you.
-Hey, what's this?

2600
02:07:58,615 --> 02:08:00,423
-This is court.
-30 seconds, sir.

2601
02:08:01,832 --> 02:08:03,338
Look, your name is
tattooed on my heart.

2602
02:08:03,905 --> 02:08:06,195
You're everything
my heart holds.

2603
02:08:07,197 --> 02:08:07,872
Look at it, sir.

2604
02:08:08,585 --> 02:08:09,827
Yeah, I saw it. Button up.

2605
02:08:11,899 --> 02:08:13,298
I love you, Karthik.

2606
02:08:13,473 --> 02:08:14,367
I love you, Chinnu!

2607
02:08:14,998 --> 02:08:18,663
Even as a judge, I fail to
understand today's girls.

2608
02:08:19,033 --> 02:08:20,033
Hey, old man!

2609
02:08:21,125 --> 02:08:23,277
Mother-in- law, I am not an old man,

2610
02:08:23,608 --> 02:08:25,698
I am your son-in-law!

2611
02:08:26,093 --> 02:08:27,111
She is carrying my baby.

2612
02:08:27,871 --> 02:08:28,576
Come on, Chinnu.

2613
02:08:29,171 --> 02:08:29,779
Thank you, sir.

2614
02:08:29,872 --> 02:08:31,172
-I'm so happy. You can go.
-Thank you, sir.

2615
02:08:31,673 --> 02:08:33,186
Hey, button up your shirt.

2616
02:08:37,097 --> 02:08:37,932
-Hello?-Yeah!

2617
02:08:38,265 --> 02:08:39,313
Time is up. Where are you people?

2618
02:08:39,570 --> 02:08:42,737
Our son-in-law came back from Delhi,
and Diya told everything to him.

2619
02:08:43,321 --> 02:08:45,970
She did? Just one more day
and it would've been fine.

2620
02:08:46,362 --> 02:08:47,479
Where is she, exactly?

2621
02:08:47,504 --> 02:08:50,180
He took the girl away so seriously.
I'm really worried.

2622
02:08:52,077 --> 02:08:53,414
Dude, next hearing is our's.

2623
02:08:54,732 --> 02:08:55,614
Diya won't be coming.

2624
02:09:05,142 --> 02:09:06,267
Hey look there, it's Diya!

2625
02:09:16,069 --> 02:09:17,816
Looks like she came
with her husband.

2626
02:09:34,172 --> 02:09:35,299
Where is he? Where?

2627
02:09:37,884 --> 02:09:38,724
He's so skinny.

2628
02:09:39,337 --> 02:09:40,803
-What is your name, brother?
-Gautham, brother.

2629
02:09:41,263 --> 02:09:43,289
He looks nice. Your
selections are always good.

2630
02:09:43,523 --> 02:09:44,989
But I didn't make a good choice.

2631
02:09:46,030 --> 02:09:50,616
I believe everyone makes mistakes,
and life always gives second chances.

2632
02:09:51,080 --> 02:09:53,914
I'm not here to give lectures.

2633
02:09:55,714 --> 02:10:00,716
My wife is already married. If my relatives
found out she came here for divorce,

2634
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:05,243
Especially during festival season,
they'd swarm us.

2635
02:10:05,596 --> 02:10:07,323
That's the reason I
brought her here in a hurry.

2636
02:10:09,258 --> 02:10:11,631
People don't join the army
just by watching Border film.

2637
02:10:11,929 --> 02:10:14,117
Gold medals aren't won just
by watching Dangal movie.

2638
02:10:15,254 --> 02:10:17,992
How can you get married just by
watching a Sakhi film? Immature people!

2639
02:10:20,413 --> 02:10:21,897
What ever it may be,
you look like a dumb skull, brother.

2640
02:10:22,104 --> 02:10:23,764
Gautham! Diya!

2641
02:10:23,933 --> 02:10:24,572
Brother...

2642
02:10:24,664 --> 02:10:29,235
It's getting late. They're calling.
Could you send your wife for five minutes?

2643
02:10:29,600 --> 02:10:30,884
I'll end it with a divorce.

2644
02:10:32,084 --> 02:10:33,244
My heart is so hard!

2645
02:10:34,076 --> 02:10:34,997
Can I go, dear?

2646
02:10:35,581 --> 02:10:37,624
Look who is asking!

2647
02:10:37,802 --> 02:10:38,533
Go!

2648
02:10:38,802 --> 02:10:40,435
Cover your face! Brother.

2649
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:41,693
Thing is...

2650
02:10:41,913 --> 02:10:45,875
There is usually someone who
supports all our foolish deeds.

2651
02:10:46,036 --> 02:10:47,394
Don't you have any such
person in your life?

2652
02:10:47,594 --> 02:10:48,205
He is the one!

2653
02:10:48,506 --> 02:10:49,726
You guys continue.
We'll return soon.

2654
02:10:51,025 --> 02:10:52,906
-What is your name?
-Jacky, brother.

2655
02:10:53,612 --> 02:10:54,499
But you're wearing VIP underwear.

2656
02:10:55,311 --> 02:10:56,858
-That's my name.
-Yes, that suits you well.

2657
02:10:57,471 --> 02:10:58,171
Jocky!

2658
02:10:58,324 --> 02:10:59,598
You are very great, brother.

2659
02:10:59,867 --> 02:11:02,409
Knowing she was already married,
you still brought her here?

2660
02:11:02,653 --> 02:11:04,015
You're more generous than
the High Court, brother.

2661
02:11:05,052 --> 02:11:06,659
-What is your name brother?
-Arya!

2662
02:11:06,886 --> 02:11:07,493
Wow!

2663
02:11:07,689 --> 02:11:10,715
The name suits the character perfectly.
This generation needs you, brother.

2664
02:11:10,979 --> 02:11:14,140
-What's all this?
-It's for boozing.

2665
02:11:14,757 --> 02:11:16,159
-What brand it is?
-Khajuraho.

2666
02:11:16,402 --> 02:11:17,249
Stay blessed!

2667
02:11:17,724 --> 02:11:20,557
Case 421, Gautham and Diya.

2668
02:11:21,201 --> 02:11:25,513
My Lord, kids are pure emotion.
Mother is all about promotion.

2669
02:11:26,482 --> 02:11:29,721
-Father is a solution.
-But when you're in court I get irritated.

2670
02:11:30,755 --> 02:11:31,713
Firstly, come to the point.

2671
02:11:31,964 --> 02:11:35,964
According to the doctor's report, my
client has no chance of having children.

2672
02:11:36,192 --> 02:11:38,192
I've already included it
in the submission, sir. please check.

2673
02:11:39,143 --> 02:11:42,181
It is clear to the court. right?
These two are here for mutual divorce.

2674
02:11:42,642 --> 02:11:43,483
So please.

2675
02:11:43,705 --> 02:11:47,153
Immediate grant of divorce
should be ordered by the court.

2676
02:11:47,618 --> 02:11:50,503
It has to be requested, not ordered.

2677
02:11:50,934 --> 02:11:52,074
-Do you think this is your home?
-Oh!

2678
02:11:52,330 --> 02:11:53,622
Sorry, you're honor.

2679
02:11:55,256 --> 02:11:56,960
Why do you think you can't have kids?

2680
02:11:57,240 --> 02:11:59,267
Because of my phone, sir.
I keep it in my front pocket.

2681
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:03,639
According to the doctor,
radiation has damaged the nerves.

2682
02:12:04,086 --> 02:12:04,972
Really?

2683
02:12:11,826 --> 02:12:16,152
-Your phone is still in your pocket.
-Either way, the damage is already done.

2684
02:12:16,657 --> 02:12:19,827
Okay.
Are you okay with this divorce ma'am?

2685
02:12:20,101 --> 02:12:20,985
Yes, sir!

2686
02:12:24,713 --> 02:12:25,538
Divorce granted!

2687
02:12:25,968 --> 02:12:28,259
-Thank you your honor!
-Thank you.

2688
02:12:39,316 --> 02:12:40,143
Sir!

2689
02:12:40,578 --> 02:12:42,618
There's no mistake.
Check it carefully.

2690
02:12:42,969 --> 02:12:43,656
What is that?

2691
02:12:44,721 --> 02:12:47,648
It's his birth certificate. I got it
from the hospital where he was born.

2692
02:12:49,531 --> 02:12:52,677
You look so dull even on your wedding day.
Smile.

2693
02:12:53,019 --> 02:12:54,004
-Cheers.
-Hey...

2694
02:12:55,047 --> 02:12:56,506
-Go back.
-Don’t overact.

2695
02:12:56,756 --> 02:12:57,682
They got to know about the truth.

2696
02:12:58,388 --> 02:12:59,235
Hi, brother-in-law.

2697
02:12:59,572 --> 02:13:01,558
-You didn't take the divorce till now?
-No!

2698
02:13:01,832 --> 02:13:04,457
There was a small communication problem,
which has been sorted now.

2699
02:13:06,225 --> 02:13:08,641
-Where is he?
-He is on the way. Five minutes

2700
02:14:24,031 --> 02:14:26,176
I got angry when Diya
spoke about your matter.

2701
02:14:26,842 --> 02:14:29,313
But Diya herself told me
the truth, so I forgave her.

2702
02:14:30,157 --> 02:14:33,360
Anyone else saying this wouldn't be
forgiven.

2703
02:14:34,105 --> 02:14:38,158
Actually, she didn't need
to confess, yet she did.

2704
02:14:38,830 --> 02:14:41,223
That's what a relationship needs honesty.

2705
02:14:42,737 --> 02:14:45,838
Guilt had built up over
not speaking the truth.

2706
02:14:46,788 --> 02:14:47,898
That burden is gone now.

2707
02:14:49,368 --> 02:14:52,040
You shouldn't start a
relationship with a lie, Gautam.

2708
02:14:53,332 --> 02:14:56,158
It's like a building built
without a foundation.

2709
02:14:56,806 --> 02:14:58,226
It could collapse at any moment.

2710
02:15:02,943 --> 02:15:04,123
I want to confess one thing.

2711
02:15:06,518 --> 02:15:07,618
I've already gotten married.

2712
02:15:14,375 --> 02:15:16,072
We got married right here.

2713
02:15:19,206 --> 02:15:20,915
In front of this same person.

2714
02:15:24,903 --> 02:15:26,403
I should've told you this earlier.

2715
02:15:29,128 --> 02:15:31,646
But I didn't because was
afraid that we'd drift apart.

2716
02:15:37,557 --> 02:15:39,088
He didn't submit a birth certificate.

2717
02:15:42,009 --> 02:15:43,107
It's a divorce certificate.

2718
02:15:51,584 --> 02:15:53,501
A relationship should never
be started with a lie.

2719
02:15:54,827 --> 02:15:56,800
I made a mistake when I was
too young to understand.

2720
02:15:58,925 --> 02:16:02,842
Keeping that mistake away from
you now would be even worse.

2721
02:16:09,615 --> 02:16:11,740
You accepted me,
even knowing we couldn't have kids.

2722
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:16,673
Even knowing I was married before,
you'll accept me as well.

2723
02:16:22,432 --> 02:16:26,682
I'm not right for a great girl like you.

2724
02:16:28,763 --> 02:16:30,003
You'll find a better guy.

2725
02:16:34,943 --> 02:16:36,135
You're right, sir.

2726
02:16:38,069 --> 02:16:39,861
Love means having disagreements.
We should meet again.

2727
02:16:41,977 --> 02:16:43,643
But after meeting again
we should not fight, sir.

2728
02:16:45,776 --> 02:16:47,359
A couple should quarrel
and then apologize.

2729
02:16:49,098 --> 02:16:50,682
We should not begin a
relationship with a sorry.

2730
02:16:54,252 --> 02:16:56,271
You knew from the start
that I wasn't right for her.

2731
02:17:18,908 --> 02:17:22,062
-Idiot! Stop talking.
-Who's that, dear?

2732
02:17:24,092 --> 02:17:26,648
-Gautham, daddy.
-Is he still calling you?

2733
02:17:27,456 --> 02:17:29,831
I am not talking to him,
I am scolding him.

2734
02:17:30,686 --> 02:17:33,103
Do you think saying sorry
and leaving is enough?

2735
02:17:33,941 --> 02:17:35,230
I'm still angry.

2736
02:17:36,573 --> 02:17:37,425
It's frustrating me.

2737
02:17:38,334 --> 02:17:40,407
I am calling him up and scolding him.

2738
02:17:40,623 --> 02:17:43,456
Scold him properly.
He played with our lives.

2739
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,042
Scold him properly. Scold him.

2740
02:17:48,959 --> 02:17:49,903
Where are you going?

2741
02:17:51,312 --> 02:17:54,195
-Going to meet Gautham, daddy.
-You did not block him yet?

2742
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:56,482
If I am blocking him,
he is texting me over phone pay.

2743
02:17:57,130 --> 02:17:59,599
I won't calm down unless
I go there and hit him.

2744
02:17:59,770 --> 02:18:00,812
Very good. Hit him!

2745
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:03,110
Go. hit him.

2746
02:18:03,276 --> 02:18:03,923
I will, dad.

2747
02:18:04,491 --> 02:18:05,741
Hit him very hard and come.

2748
02:18:06,016 --> 02:18:06,636
Sir!

2749
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:10,046
You said fighting means love.
Now they're fighting.

2750
02:18:10,726 --> 02:18:13,143
-Do you call this love?
-This is just a fight.

2751
02:18:16,055 --> 02:18:17,809
-Look this, sir!
-Daddy, give me your phone.

2752
02:18:18,441 --> 02:18:21,524
-Why, dear?
-Gautham has blocked me.

2753
02:18:22,678 --> 02:18:27,097
I should be the one to block him?
Why should he block? I will kill him.

2754
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:30,473
Sir!

2755
02:18:30,958 --> 02:18:34,728
Blocking and still calling this isn't
love, sir. It's a full-blown fight.

2756
02:18:38,499 --> 02:18:39,279
Where are you going?

2757
02:18:39,786 --> 02:18:41,536
To have a fight with Gautham?

2758
02:18:42,163 --> 02:18:44,163
Yes, daddy. I need to kill him.

2759
02:18:44,921 --> 02:18:45,828
Shut your mouth.

2760
02:18:46,642 --> 02:18:48,025
I have been seeing the same
thing from past 2 years.

2761
02:18:48,690 --> 02:18:50,658
I have been looking for alliances.
You are saying no to everything.

2762
02:18:51,093 --> 02:18:51,726
But...

2763
02:18:52,102 --> 02:18:53,777
You call it a fight
and talk on the phone.

2764
02:18:54,969 --> 02:18:56,277
You say you're scolding him
and keep chatting with him.

2765
02:18:57,137 --> 02:19:00,118
You say you'll hit him,
yet you're going to see him.

2766
02:19:01,168 --> 02:19:01,902
Look!

2767
02:19:02,172 --> 02:19:03,714
You're both in love.

2768
02:19:04,538 --> 02:19:07,371
-We're not in love, daddy.
-You are in love!

2769
02:19:08,374 --> 02:19:11,243
I may have said no, but this is love.

2770
02:19:12,457 --> 02:19:14,998
Come,
let's go and talk about the marriage.

2771
02:19:15,837 --> 02:19:16,842
Keep quite and come.

2772
02:19:19,417 --> 02:19:21,507
-Advait, my son!
-Karthik.

2773
02:19:22,170 --> 02:19:23,587
-Brother-in-law!
-Where is your son?

2774
02:19:24,619 --> 02:19:27,821
-You are talking about him?
-Not about him.

2775
02:19:28,543 --> 02:19:30,043
I am talking about your
anaconda, your elder one.

2776
02:19:30,321 --> 02:19:34,029
He's making love-song reels
because his love failed.

2777
02:19:34,887 --> 02:19:35,520
Go, dear!

2778
02:19:36,832 --> 02:19:39,957
Hey dude let's make a good reel.
Play Raja's song.

2779
02:19:40,397 --> 02:19:42,512
Raja's song is better avoided.
Cases are being filed.

2780
02:19:42,700 --> 02:19:45,116
We need to wander around
the courts once again.

2781
02:19:45,419 --> 02:19:48,211
-I will play MM @Kreem songs, have fun.
-Okay!

2782
02:19:49,793 --> 02:19:53,326
[singing]

2783
02:19:55,898 --> 02:19:58,645
[lady singing]

2784
02:20:09,704 --> 02:20:12,745
What did our girl see
in your boy to love him?

2785
02:20:14,018 --> 02:20:16,058
Leave it! Pallavi...

2786
02:20:17,716 --> 02:20:19,216
What did she see in you and loved you?

2787
02:20:21,171 --> 02:20:22,559
Love is blind, Brother-in-law!

2788
02:20:23,781 --> 02:20:25,751
Single males like you won't understand.

2789
02:20:26,166 --> 02:20:29,326
The number you are trying to
call is currently not reachable.

2790
02:20:29,533 --> 02:20:31,099
Please try again later.
