1
00:01:32,284 --> 00:01:34,286
Oh boy.

2
00:01:34,555 --> 00:01:37,790
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy,
oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

3
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,091
Ha ha!

4
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:40,928
It's time!

5
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:43,698
Stand aside, stand
aside, Gibor! Ha ha!

6
00:01:43,798 --> 00:01:45,396
Thank you, Abirra.
Thank you, Yala.

7
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:52,304
Oh! Hey, hey, hey, Shira.

8
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:54,241
Don't worry, I got you.

9
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,408
You're a bit early,
aren't you girl?

10
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,513
Stand back, everyone.

11
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,247
The flock's about to
get a little bigger.

12
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:03,483
It's okay girl, you're good.

13
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:05,619
Just breathe.

14
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:07,353
We'll get this little one out,

15
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:08,956
then I promise...

16
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:13,460
I'll bring you home.

17
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:22,637
Stay together.

18
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,341
If we stay close, stay tight,

19
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:28,544
it won't be able to
single anyone out.

20
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:33,448
I can't do this alone.

21
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:38,455
No, wait!

22
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,346
Just stay quiet girl.

23
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,280
He hasn't seen you.

24
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,022
That's it.

25
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,490
Eyes on me.

26
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,860
On...

27
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:14,562
Me.

28
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:19,498
No, no, no, no!

29
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:21,501
No!

30
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,643
No!

31
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:38,487
God spoke to me.

32
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,323
Eh, it comes with
being a prophet.

33
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:42,793
Oh!

34
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:45,796
He told me very clearly

35
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:49,430
that I was to come
to this very house

36
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:52,036
and anoint a son of Jesse

37
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:56,107
to be the next king.

38
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,377
But

39
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,414
it is none of these.

40
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:08,719
That one had potential
though.

41
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:17,697
Unless, perhaps you
have another son?

42
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:27,505
Oh, no.

43
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:29,042
Shira.

44
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:30,675
Shira!

45
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,179
No!

46
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,751
Shira.

47
00:04:38,753 --> 00:04:42,090
I'm so sorry.

48
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:50,030
Huh? What?

49
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:51,365
Shira?

50
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:53,434
Shira, you're alive?!

51
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:55,669
Oh.

52
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,983
Oh, ho, ho!

53
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,017
That'll teach you to
mess with my sheep.

54
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:10,554
Whoo!

55
00:05:11,822 --> 00:05:14,158
I'm so glad you're okay.

56
00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:16,458
And who is this little one?

57
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:20,798
Oh. Oh, she's my lamb, is she?

58
00:05:22,233 --> 00:05:23,700
Tali.

59
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:25,570
Well, Tali.

60
00:05:26,138 --> 00:05:28,204
Let's go and introduce you to
the others and get you home.

61
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:34,179
Wait here, girl.

62
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:05,111
Whew.

63
00:06:12,854 --> 00:06:14,988
Whooo! Ha ha.

64
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,526
Now, where are the others?

65
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:28,369
Hey! Hey, it's okay,
he's gone, you're safe.

66
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,604
You can come out now.

67
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:33,174
Don't you want to come out?

68
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:34,609
Meet the new baby?

69
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,652
I know that was scary,

70
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,420
but doesn't it make
you feel more alive?

71
00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:45,957
And do you know what?

72
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,823
I don't see a bunch
of scared sheep.

73
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,293
Do you know what I see?

74
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:52,998
Mighty horses! Ready
to take on the world!

75
00:06:56,702 --> 00:06:58,670
I'm scared too sometimes,

76
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,040

00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:10,911
Huh?

135
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,514
Hmm.

136
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:16,949
Er. Sh-Shalom.

137
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:18,752
It-It wasn't me.

138
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:21,722
And if it was, I can explain.

139
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:23,222
Maybe.

140
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:25,126
Uh, what's happening?

141
00:10:25,493 --> 00:10:27,695
Remember when I told you
God had big plans for you?

142
00:10:29,331 --> 00:10:31,666
Well, they may have been
bigger than even I thought.

143
00:10:31,668 --> 00:10:33,503
David,

144
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,938
son of Jesse.

145
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:39,941
Are you ready for
a great adventure?

146
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:42,345
Uh, yes!

147
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,646
As King of Israel.

148
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:45,947
What? No.

149
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:46,948
No?

150
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,119
No, no, no, no.

151
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,421
Don't mess this
up for me, David.

152
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,758
If you're king, then I
get to be a princess.

153
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:57,259
I can't be king.

154
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:58,561
We already have a king.

155
00:10:58,563 --> 00:11:00,195
That's right.

156
00:11:00,197 --> 00:11:02,064
Which makes this treason.

157
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,904
Oh, now it's treason?

158
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:08,974
And, uh, what was it when
he was considering you?

159
00:11:09,107 --> 00:11:12,277
Ugh, I am a soldier
in Saul's army!

160
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:14,879
I have been nothing but
faithful to my father,

161
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:17,214
King Saul, and God!

162
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:19,216
That is wonderful.

163
00:11:19,218 --> 00:11:21,154
Continue to do so.

164
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,289
You can't take the youngest

165
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:25,923
and elevate him
above the rest of us!

166
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,561
Do you want me to take his place

167
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,462
and shepherd the flock again?

168
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,063
No, Ozem will take
over shepherding.

169
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:33,666
Wait, what?

170
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:35,903
No. Nethanel can do it.

171
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,570
I'm not doing it.

172
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,039
The twins can do it.

173
00:11:39,173 --> 00:11:40,338
- Don't bring us into this.
- Yeah.

174
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,741
- Boys.
- Whatever.

175
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,112
Don't look at me.

176
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,582
- Way to go.
- Way to go, David.

177
00:11:46,615 --> 00:11:48,983
Boys.

178
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,185
Sorry.

179
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:54,557
I like it. Do it again.

180
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:58,160
I do not come here lightly.

181
00:11:58,494 --> 00:12:02,098
The very hearts of the
people are at stake.

182
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:04,934
There is the darkness
over the land.

183
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:07,136
Philistines?

184
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,772
The Philistines are
a threat, to be sure.

185
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:14,844
They lord over us
with power and pride.

186
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:19,950
But there is a graver
danger we face.

187
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:22,353
Amalekites?

188
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:24,521
The Amalekites are
nothing but scavengers.

189
00:12:24,523 --> 00:12:27,490
And they are always watching,

190
00:12:27,492 --> 00:12:31,396
always waiting in the shadows.

191
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:34,799
Just as they preyed on
the weak and vulnerable

192
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,934
when we escaped Pharaoh,

193
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:40,640
they wait for us to be divided,

194
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:44,042
for the sheep to scatter

195
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:47,713
and they will strike once more.

196
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:55,787
But our true battle is not
against flesh and blood,

197
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:57,991
but in our hearts.

198
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,994
Did our enemies make
us turn away from God?

199
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:04,398
No. We demanded a king.

200
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,235
So, God gave us King Saul

201
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:11,839
whose love of the crown
has consumed him.

202
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:14,340
And now, we see the cost

203
00:13:14,342 --> 00:13:17,279
of putting our faith in man.

204
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:21,080
Philistines, Amalekites,

205
00:13:21,082 --> 00:13:22,618
Saul.

206
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:26,222
We are hard pressed
on every side.

207
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:29,325
But at last,

208
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,428
God has chosen another.

209
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:36,633
Someone with a heart after His.

210
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:39,269
But I don't want to be king.

211
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:43,271
That is surprisingly
good criteria for a king.

212
00:13:43,273 --> 00:13:45,073
I'm just a shepherd.

213
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,877
The people are lost, David.

214
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:50,583
Astray in a storm.

215
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:53,416
A shepherd

216
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:56,454
is precisely who they need.

217
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:59,488
But God is my shepherd.
He's who we need.

218
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,660
Every excuse you give

219
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,996
is another reason
it must be you.

220
00:14:04,998 --> 00:14:07,433
But... Yes?

221
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:22,182
Stand before me, son of Jesse.

222
00:14:42,337 --> 00:14:47,677
♪ Ba-ruch haba ♪

223

230
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:48,576
So, what happens now?

231
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,976
Do Saul and David
fight to the death?

232
00:15:50,978 --> 00:15:53,146
No. No.

233
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:56,116
This is a gift that
must remain secret.

234
00:15:58,987 --> 00:16:00,656
We have heard
about David's gift.

235
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:03,090
He must come before
King Saul at once.

236
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:04,459
They couldn't have known.

237
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,194
What have you
brought on our house?

238
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:09,197
They cannot know I'm here.

239
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:12,265
If Saul finds out about this,
none of you will be safe.

240
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:13,233
Zeruiah, no!

241
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:15,103
Who goes there?

242
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:18,140
It is I, Princess Zeruiah.

243
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:20,910
Hmph, is David here?

244
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:24,347
Get out of here.
We'll distract him.

245
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,082
Sh-Shalom.

246
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:29,317
King Saul is greatly disturbed.

247
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:31,053
David must come with me at once.

248
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:33,724
I- I-Look, David is.

249
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:35,292
Here.

250
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,529
I'm right here.

251
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,362
Oh, dear boy.

252
00:16:40,364 --> 00:16:42,165
He is going to eat you alive.

253
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,588
Welcome to Gibeah.

254
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,623
Hey, you.

255
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:05,926
Strawberries!

256
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,560
Get your fresh picked
strawberries here!

257
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:10,327
Get your fresh fruit here!

258
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:17,271
Here we go.

259
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,673
- On the count of three.
- Come on.

260
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,007
Get some more tension
into that line, boys!

261
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,208
All right.

262
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,441
Finally, you're here!

263
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:32,922
Where
do you want this one?

264
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:34,924
Just
like that. Good, good.

265
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:43,800
Woo-hoo-hoo!

266
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,839
This is the one from
Bethlehem, Your Grace.

267
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:51,974
Where is your instrument?

268
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:54,442
Er, instrument?

269
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:56,245
You can't exactly
play for my husband

270
00:17:56,247 --> 00:17:57,980
without an instrument.

271
00:17:57,982 --> 00:17:59,316
Play?

272
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:01,517
And you can't go
before him like this.

273
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,853
What's in your hair?

274
00:18:02,855 --> 00:18:04,422
Oil?

275
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,292
Uh. Whoa.

276
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:12,564
Whoo!

277
00:18:15,033 --> 00:18:16,067
Sorry.

278
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:18,270
Oh, not at all.

279
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:21,305
In fact, here, why don't
you stand in front of me?

280
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:22,776
Oh, okay.

281
00:18:25,078 --> 00:18:26,611
Wait a second.

282
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:27,345
Where do you think
you are going?

283
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:28,815
Prince Jonathan,

284
00:18:29,116 --> 00:18:31,617
we really must see your
father quite urgently.

285
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:33,621
Now's really not the best time.

286
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:36,487
The affairs of state
cannot be put on hold

287
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:37,892
while you pacify your father's.

288
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,325
Do you think
this is helping me?!

289
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:45,464
We'll put the affairs
of state on hold now.

290
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:46,933
Clearly it's not the best time.

291
00:18:46,935 --> 00:18:48,603
What's going on?

292
00:18:48,904 --> 00:18:51,738
Saul called for every
musician in the kingdom.

293
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,074
Music used to soothe him.

294
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:55,609
Get out, and
don't come back!

295
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:59,081
Yes, Your Highness.

296
00:18:59,215 --> 00:19:01,348
Ah, why don't you take my place?

297
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,917
Oh, please. In front of me.

298
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:04,620
No, I insist. Take my place.

299
00:19:04,987 --> 00:19:06,789
- Don't let me get in your way.
- Up to the front.

300
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,028
Ah.

301
00:19:13,597 --> 00:19:15,429
Hey, kid.

302
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:16,264
What are you doing here?

303
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:17,065
Next!

304
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:23,541
I guess it's your turn.

305
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:54,674
Shhhh...

306
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:03,415
They think a child can help me?

307
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:09,123
Are you going to sing, or what?

308
00:20:09,256 --> 00:20:11,994
Well I... I don't have my...

309
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:14,527
If I could just...

310
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:15,996
Get out!

311
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:25,106
Next.

312
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:26,576
No, wait!

313
00:20:28,277 --> 00:20:30,580
Can I borrow this? Thank you.

314
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:33,647
You're
going back in there?

315
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,184
I know right?

316
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:46,196
Huh? Why are you back here?

317
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,834
Because now I've got this.

318
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:53,470
Just leave me in peace.

319
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:55,206
I'm gonna try.

He-he-he didn't like it.

347
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:45,556
What's your name?

348
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:47,326
David.

349
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,163
Well David, I can't remember

350
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,598
the last time I
felt like that...

351
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,001
Free.

352
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:01,739
You know, I never
asked for this.

353
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:02,873
I didn't want to be king.

354
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,310
Me neither.

355
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:07,411
I mean, I can imagine.

356
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,849
Can you, David?

357
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:13,254
One minute you're tending
your father's donkeys,

358
00:24:13,655 --> 00:24:17,424
the next Samuel anoints
you to be king of Israel.

359
00:24:21,228 --> 00:24:24,931
And then, after all these years,

360
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:27,269
after all I've done for Israel

361
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:34,109
he tries to-to take it from me,

362
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:36,144
says he's going to
give it to another.

363
00:24:37,748 --> 00:24:40,783
If I get my hands
on that prophet.

364
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,855
If I find out who it is Samuel
has chosen to replace me...

365
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:53,130
But then you came along.

366
00:24:55,332 --> 00:24:59,034
Father, the Philistines.
The Philistines amass for war.

367
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:03,674
Today is a bad day for
them to pick a fight.

368
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:05,944
Ready my horse.

369
00:25:06,344 --> 00:25:08,911
David, you have done your
king a great service.

370
00:25:08,913 --> 00:25:10,481
Return to your fields.

371
00:25:11,282 --> 00:25:13,718
And while you're there, write
a victory song for my return.

372
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,104
This is not what
I signed up for.

373
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:33,404
So this is not
going to end well.

374
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,841
Come on men.

375
00:25:35,342 --> 00:25:39,211
Spirits up, you are mighty
soldiers in the Israelite army.

376
00:25:39,213 --> 00:25:41,282
If by mighty you mean scared

377
00:25:41,717 --> 00:25:44,919
and by soldiers you mean
farmers, then sure, that's us.

378
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,119
You underestimate
who's on our side.

379
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:49,056
Do you see this, Jonathan?

380
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:51,156
We haven't even faced
the Philistines yet.

381
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:54,094
I did this to myself, with this.

382
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:55,797
It's not even a real weapon.

383
00:25:55,997 --> 00:25:58,200
- Ow.
- I am so sorry. Are you okay?

384
00:25:58,534 --> 00:26:01,303
- Yup, we're dead.
- Have a little faith men.

385
00:26:01,604 --> 00:26:06,273
Oh I do have a little
faith, very little.

386
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:45,918
Saul, Saul, Saul.

387
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:49,255
I thought we had an agreement.

388
00:26:49,355 --> 00:26:51,321
I allow you and
your little tribes

389
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:53,123
to live in this land and you

390
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,959
I know our agreement Achish.

391
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,396
We pay your taxes,

392
00:26:56,764 --> 00:26:58,566
we get our tools sharpened
by your blacksmiths.

393
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:01,667
Well I must say, a
lot of your tools

394
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:03,604
are looking very pointy.

395
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,139
That was not part
of our arrangement.

396
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,344
Well, perhaps it's time
to come to new terms.

397
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:13,045
Ooh, those are
fighting words Saul.

398
00:27:13,047 --> 00:27:14,815
Your army is clearly

399
00:27:14,817 --> 00:27:16,217
no match for mine.

400
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,416
I would rather
not kill all those

401
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:20,355
potential workers for my fields,

402
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:22,525
so why don't we
make this simpler?

403
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:27,429
Your best warrior, against mine?

404
00:27:27,831 --> 00:27:31,231
Father, you're more than
a match for any Philistine.

405
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:34,770
Besides, God fights for us.

406
00:27:34,772 --> 00:27:37,474
So be it.

407
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:39,575
Choose your man
to fight, Achish.

408
00:27:39,577 --> 00:27:41,144
Good.

409
00:27:41,444 --> 00:27:44,045
Very good. Very, very,
very good.

410
00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:45,582
Deal.

411
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:47,917
Bring out Goliath.

412
00:28:10,676 --> 00:28:12,945
He's huge.

413
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:16,683
Oh, that's not him.
That's his armor bearer.

414
00:29:12,242 --> 00:29:14,478
- He's huge.
- Like a mountain.

415
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:16,378
He's the biggest
thing I've ever seen,

416
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,048
and I once seen a whale.

417
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:23,488
I like horses.

418
00:29:25,156 --> 00:29:28,994
Not much else will
fill me up.

419
00:29:42,943 --> 00:29:47,411
This day, Goliath defies
the ranks of Israel.

420
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:49,783
Choose a man to fight me.

421
00:29:50,985 --> 00:29:55,657
If he wins, the Philistines
will be your subjects.

422
00:29:56,256 --> 00:30:01,128
If I beat him,
you will serve us.

423
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:06,167
Summon my advisors.

424
00:30:11,272 --> 00:30:14,575
Don't worry, take your time.

425
00:30:14,577 --> 00:30:17,513
Goliath is nothing if not

426
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:19,248
patient.

427
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:41,003
Shimea get an Ephah of grain.

428
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,170
What's an Ephah?

429
00:30:42,172 --> 00:30:44,240
Ozem, the sheep.

430
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,054
Ima, Ima, look.

431
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,824
Yes, dear. It's beautiful.

432
00:30:58,658 --> 00:31:00,560
Hmm, stress weaving again?

433
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:03,228
I'm allowed.

434
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,765
Eliab and Abinadab have
been called to war,

435
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,699
I still don't know
what happening with...

436
00:31:08,602 --> 00:31:09,267
David.

437
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:10,805
David!

438
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:14,174
Oh yay. Ow.

439
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:18,311
Oh, I missed you guys.

440
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:21,280
Are you king yet?
Do you have a crown?

441
00:31:21,282 --> 00:31:23,016
Can I wear it?

442
00:31:23,018 --> 00:31:25,350
No.

443
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:26,755
David.

444
00:31:26,988 --> 00:31:28,822
It's a relief to see
you in one piece.

445
00:31:28,824 --> 00:31:29,758
Are you all right?

446
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,925
Did he find out
about the anointing?

447
00:31:31,927 --> 00:31:33,526
Have you eaten?

448
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:35,096
Is the family in danger?

449
00:31:35,098 --> 00:31:36,429
They touched your hair.

450
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:38,165
What happened with Saul?

451
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:40,000
Nothing happened.

452
00:31:40,002 --> 00:31:42,304
What's going on here?

453
00:31:42,705 --> 00:31:45,808
Well, the town has been
asked for supplies for the war.

454
00:31:47,243 --> 00:31:48,476
Where are the supplies?

455
00:31:48,478 --> 00:31:50,344
I got hungry.

456
00:31:50,346 --> 00:31:53,282
From the house to the donkey?

457
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:58,822
Huh-uh-uh. Where do
you think you're going?

458
00:31:59,057 --> 00:32:00,355
You haven't told me
what happened yet.

459
00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:02,393
Nothing, it's all okay.

460
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,495
I just want to head
back to the fields.

461
00:32:04,763 --> 00:32:06,629
Saul was troubled
and I played for him,

462
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:08,097
that's all.

463
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,644
I just... The whole
time I was in Gibeah,

464
00:32:20,646 --> 00:32:22,380
nothing made sense.

465
00:32:23,448 --> 00:32:24,850
Am I meant to lie?

466
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,956
Am I meant to help
Saul, or hate him,

467
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,990
or obey him, or fight him?

468
00:32:34,194 --> 00:32:36,563
I just don't know!

469
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:40,601
Things are simple out there.

470
00:32:41,368 --> 00:32:43,905
Everything makes sense.

471
00:32:44,371 --> 00:32:47,809
But with the anointing,
with the king thing

472
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:52,245
I just don't
understand what God's doing.

473
00:32:52,247 --> 00:32:54,315
Nor do I.

474
00:32:55,316 --> 00:32:57,117
And that's why I do this.

475
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:59,052
Stress-weaving again?

476
00:32:59,054 --> 00:33:00,821
That's not the point.

477
00:33:00,823 --> 00:33:04,527
Look here. Beautiful isn't it?

478
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,363
Um, it's not your best.

479
00:33:08,531 --> 00:33:11,265
Every
thread has a purpose.

480
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:12,936
They all have a place.

481
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:15,672
It looks messy, but when
you see the finished picture

482
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:18,976
on the other side,
they all make sense.

483
00:33:20,077 --> 00:33:21,944
You're just like one
of these threads.

484
00:33:22,513 --> 00:33:24,112
Am even I there?

485
00:33:24,114 --> 00:33:28,551
Yup, here you are
and there's Tali.

486
00:33:28,553 --> 00:33:30,989
Yes Ozem, even you.

487
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:33,289
Uh, Ima.

488
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:34,489
I love you.

489
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:36,260
Ima!

490
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,032
Hey let me see.

491
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:43,468
Nope, it's not finished yet.

492
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:45,536
Play me something.

493
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:47,039
But...

494
00:33:47,106 --> 00:33:48,875
Go on, something new.

495
00:33:51,677 --> 00:33:54,079
♪ I don't know what to play ♪

496
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:56,517

00:37:27,176 --> 00:37:29,613
Someone needs to take
our supplies to the army.

557
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:33,949
They wouldn't arrive with
Nethanel, perhaps Ozem?

558
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,690
I know who can take it, right?

00:37:50,802 --> 00:37:54,239
Here, look after Tali

00:37:57,476 --> 00:37:59,511
Right.

561
00:37:59,513 --> 00:38:02,014
Wait, where's David going?

562
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:14,425
Fresh
supplies over here.

563
00:38:18,732 --> 00:38:20,568
Hey kid, over here!

564
00:38:20,902 --> 00:38:23,068
I laugh
while you cower.

565
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,039
Where are you going?

566
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:29,241
Excuse me.

567
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:30,711
David!

568
00:38:31,513 --> 00:38:33,146
What are you doing here?

569
00:38:33,148 --> 00:38:35,382
I brought cheese and bread.

570
00:38:35,384 --> 00:38:37,619
Ooh, and figs.

571
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,521
I defeat you
without lifting a finger.

572
00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:43,759
Who's doing all the shouting?

573
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:45,995
You are putting the
whole family in danger

574
00:38:46,162 --> 00:38:48,698
by being here to
what? Watch a battle?

575
00:38:48,965 --> 00:38:51,901
Oh calm down Eliab,
who wouldn't want to see

576
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:54,735
the glorious Israelite
army in action?

577
00:38:56,105 --> 00:38:57,674
You are
an army of cowards.

578
00:38:58,342 --> 00:39:00,644
- He's not wrong.
- Fair point, fair point.

579
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:03,681
Not even your
God can save you

580
00:39:03,781 --> 00:39:05,649
from the might of
the Philistines.

581
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:08,252
Oh yeah? Come over here
and we'll see about that.

582
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:10,253
Sh-sh-shhh, Goliath
might hear you.

583
00:39:10,255 --> 00:39:11,790
Who's Goliath?

584
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,559
Imagine the biggest
warrior you have ever seen.

585
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,960
Okay?

586
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:19,095
Now imagine somebody ate him.

587
00:39:19,097 --> 00:39:21,333
It doesn't matter how big he is.

588
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:25,035
With God on our side,
even I could fight him.

589
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:26,303
- You?
- Yes.

590
00:39:28,441 --> 00:39:30,910
He thinks he can beat
Goliath!

591
00:39:31,477 --> 00:39:35,847
With God fighting for us it
could be you, or you, or you.

592
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:39,251
Me?

593
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:43,321
Well, looks
like it's going to be you.

594
00:39:46,793 --> 00:39:50,031
I cannot wait to
see who you send to face me.

595
00:39:50,131 --> 00:39:51,764
What about our new
treaty proposal?

596
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:54,102
Sire, with all due respect,

597
00:39:54,369 --> 00:39:57,038
King Achish knows he
has the upper hand.

598
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:59,007
He will not be interested
in a new treaty.

599
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:00,473
Yes, but was it
presented to him?

600
00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:01,743
What did he say?

601
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:04,713
He said, "I have the upper hand,

602
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:06,448
and I am not interested
in a new treaty."

603
00:40:06,616 --> 00:40:08,815
Father, we're out of options.

604
00:40:08,817 --> 00:40:10,319
I will go and fight him.

605
00:40:10,654 --> 00:40:13,355
I will not send my son
on a suicide mission.

606
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,625
This Philistine is no
match for the God of Israel.

607
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:18,128
I said no!

608
00:40:20,731 --> 00:40:21,996
You again?

609
00:40:21,998 --> 00:40:24,832
A song can do little here, boy.

610
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:26,101
I haven't come to sing.

611
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:28,706
Then why are you here?

612
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:31,042
I- I will fight Goliath.

613
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,718
I'm serious. I
will fight Goliath.

614
00:40:40,085 --> 00:40:44,056
Ah David. Once again you
have lightened my spirits.

615
00:40:44,156 --> 00:40:45,922
Your presence here
is most welcome.

616
00:40:45,924 --> 00:40:48,193
You're so small.

617
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:50,462
What difference does
size make to a giant?

618
00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:53,099
I will rip
him limb from limb.

619
00:40:53,366 --> 00:40:54,999
You're not afraid to
go out there alone?

620
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:56,469
I won't be alone.

621
00:40:56,936 --> 00:40:59,437
Oh this is ridiculous.
Just look at him.

622
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:01,707
Yeah, look at me.

623
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:05,212
I've fought lions and bears, Me!

624
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:08,349
God protected me when they
came for my father's sheep,

625
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:11,118
and He will do the
same against Goliath.

626
00:41:11,653 --> 00:41:15,823
And I saw him tame one other
beast when no others could.

627
00:41:17,092 --> 00:41:20,328
Is that what I've
become, a beast?

628
00:41:21,296 --> 00:41:24,799
I know who you really are.

629
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:29,070
The one God chose
to lead His people.

630
00:41:29,204 --> 00:41:31,508
I know you still
recognize His voice.

631
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:33,907
What is it telling you?

632
00:41:36,546 --> 00:41:39,148
Sire, you cannot
be considering...

633
00:41:39,616 --> 00:41:41,315
Suit him up.

634
00:41:43,453 --> 00:41:45,186
But sire...

635
00:41:45,188 --> 00:41:47,922
Or you could go, if you want?

636
00:41:47,924 --> 00:41:49,391
Get him ready.

637
00:41:53,296 --> 00:41:54,898
I defeat you without.

638
00:41:55,066 --> 00:41:56,666
Is that really
necessary? Okay.

639
00:41:56,668 --> 00:41:59,003
Today we will see if
God is still with us...

640
00:42:00,606 --> 00:42:02,173
Or not.

641
00:42:02,841 --> 00:42:05,076
I can't go out in this.

642
00:42:05,343 --> 00:42:07,779
You're right, there
are still too many gaps.

643
00:42:07,781 --> 00:42:10,215
Here, here, and here.

644
00:42:12,985 --> 00:42:14,284
Much better.

645
00:42:14,286 --> 00:42:16,621
Yes, but can he move?

646
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:18,525
Of course he can.

647
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:20,593
You can, can't you?

648
00:42:21,595 --> 00:42:22,828
David?

649
00:42:24,665 --> 00:42:26,333
Oh dear.

650
00:42:26,534 --> 00:42:29,537
Who's it
going to be, Saul?

651
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,639
Huh.

652
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:31,768
♪ I will not be afraid... ♪

653
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:38,177
Uh-oh.

654
00:43:39,144 --> 00:43:40,812
David, you fool.

655
00:44:12,413 --> 00:44:14,148
Silence.

656
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,934
Uh, where are you going?

657
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:35,102
This is an insult.

658
00:44:35,104 --> 00:44:37,608
Yes, a great insult.

659
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,377
An insult you should crush.

660
00:44:40,645 --> 00:44:44,614
A child? You expect
me to fight a child?

661
00:44:44,616 --> 00:44:47,752
No. No no no no.

662
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:50,687
No, no way. No, of course not.

663
00:44:52,925 --> 00:44:56,961
But yes, that's exactly
what I expect you to do.

664
00:44:58,598 --> 00:45:00,566
Do you think this is a game?

665
00:45:04,638 --> 00:45:08,974
I will make you
a snack for the crows.

666
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:12,611
Or maybe they'll
get a giant feast.

667
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:18,218
I suppose it would be a shame

668
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:21,053
to have come all
this way for nothing.

669
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:23,658
Marvelous.

670
00:46:04,135 --> 00:46:06,571
Oops, missed.

671
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,643
Are you sure you want
to continue this, kid?

672
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,843
You don't even
have a real weapon.

673
00:46:13,845 --> 00:46:15,845
Maybe he can't lift one.

674
00:46:21,554 --> 00:46:23,388
You think your weapons
can do anything

675
00:46:23,523 --> 00:46:25,692
against the God
who parted the sea?

676
00:46:25,925 --> 00:46:28,159
The God who came in
a pillar of fire?

677
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:31,564
Wait, what are you saying?

678
00:46:31,864 --> 00:46:34,199
You come against me
with sword and spear,

679
00:46:34,935 --> 00:46:37,270
but I come against you

680
00:46:37,571 --> 00:46:39,640
in the name of the God
of heaven and earth.

681
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:44,812
The battle is His and He
will give you into our hands.

682
00:46:53,988 --> 00:46:56,891
By Dagon. Here I was

683
00:46:57,491 --> 00:47:01,797
thinking that Saul had sent
a boy to do a man's job.

684
00:47:02,297 --> 00:47:07,803
While actually, he was
setting me up to fight a God.

685
00:47:10,005 --> 00:47:11,641
Well that's more like it.

686
00:47:12,142 --> 00:47:14,276
This I can get behind.

687
00:47:15,011 --> 00:47:19,181
Who would like to see
Goliath take on a God!

688
00:47:24,287 --> 00:47:26,924
I accept
Your challenge.

689
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:32,730
And I now challenge You to
show Yourself and let us fight.

690
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:36,501
Come down here, Israelite God,

691
00:47:37,268 --> 00:47:43,339
and I will make you kneel
before the might of Goliath!

692
00:47:59,259 --> 00:48:00,827
Ah!

693
00:48:38,734 --> 00:48:41,404
Do you really think one stone

694
00:48:41,538 --> 00:48:44,440
is enough to defeat
my entire army?

695
00:49:14,206 --> 00:49:15,741
Yaah!

696
00:49:21,447 --> 00:49:23,016
Hm?

697
00:49:33,294 --> 00:49:35,361
Did you see that, Eliab.

698
00:49:35,363 --> 00:49:37,330
That's our brother!

699
00:49:41,068 --> 00:49:43,102
God is with him, father.

700
00:49:43,104 --> 00:49:44,271
God is with him!

701
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:45,841
Yaahhh!

702
00:49:52,915 --> 00:49:54,014
I told you.

703
00:49:56,485 --> 00:49:59,722
But now he will need God
more than ever.

704
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,694
Please. Look after him.

705
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:19,508
It's the king!

706
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:21,545
Here comes the king!

707
00:50:38,965 --> 00:50:41,734
David! David! David!

708
00:50:43,536 --> 00:50:45,970
David, you saved us!

709
00:50:45,972 --> 00:50:47,639
I lent him my lyre, you know.

710
00:50:47,641 --> 00:50:49,274
You're our champion!

711
00:50:49,276 --> 00:50:51,209
He is brave, he is true.

712
00:50:51,211 --> 00:50:52,344
No!

713
00:50:52,346 --> 00:50:53,278
- No?
- No?

714
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,779
No! It's not about me.

715
00:50:54,781 --> 00:50:56,881
And he's so humble too!

716
00:50:56,883 --> 00:50:59,084
David! David! David!

717
00:50:59,086 --> 00:51:00,386
No!

718
00:51:00,388 --> 00:51:02,422
Don't look at me, look at God.

719
00:51:02,724 --> 00:51:05,093
Just look at him, the
way he looks at God.

720
00:51:05,126 --> 00:51:06,491
No, you don't get it.

721
00:51:06,493 --> 00:51:07,662
What don't we get?

722
00:51:07,729 --> 00:51:08,694
- We don't get it.
- Tell us!

723
00:51:08,696 --> 00:51:09,762
But he does!

724
00:51:09,764 --> 00:51:11,664
Yeah tell us.

725
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:13,233
Okay, okay, listen, listen!

726
00:51:13,235 --> 00:51:15,004
Everyone quiet!

727
00:51:15,704 --> 00:51:18,005
David's going to speak!

728
00:51:18,007 --> 00:51:20,075
Er...

729
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:21,877

David!

789
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:07,852
You have given our people

790
00:55:07,854 --> 00:55:10,023
hope once more!

791
00:55:10,123 --> 00:55:13,393
We have never been so united.

792
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:18,632
Now is the time
to fully establish

793
00:55:18,634 --> 00:55:20,966
the glory of our kingdom!

794
00:55:24,038 --> 00:55:27,140
We will strike each
Philistine outpost.

795
00:55:27,142 --> 00:55:29,276
Starting with Ziklag.

796
00:55:29,278 --> 00:55:31,746
We will crush them underfoot,

797
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:34,682
the way they once crushed us!

798
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:41,291
And who better to lead us
into battle than David!

799
00:55:42,992 --> 00:55:45,059
My king, would you
like us to enquire of God

800
00:55:45,061 --> 00:55:46,695
if this is His will?

801
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:51,134
I am God's anointed king.

802
00:55:51,168 --> 00:55:54,371
My bidding is His will.

803
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:23,936
Whoa!

804
00:56:34,281 --> 00:56:35,681
What happened to
the Philistines?

805
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,351
It's abandoned.

806
00:56:37,585 --> 00:56:39,886
They left
everything behind.

807
00:56:44,058 --> 00:56:46,394
Why would they
leave in such a hurry?

808
00:56:50,766 --> 00:56:52,333
What is it?

809
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:54,102
Amalekites.

810
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:02,543
Stop!

811
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:04,413
Father?

812
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,815
Saul.

813
00:57:07,518 --> 00:57:09,085
No.

814
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,886
Father? What is it?

815
00:57:11,888 --> 00:57:13,490
Father?

816
00:57:13,591 --> 00:57:15,356
We must leave this place.

817
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:16,457
- Now.
- But father.

818
00:57:16,459 --> 00:57:17,961
I said now!

819
00:57:37,149 --> 00:57:37,981
Saul.

820
00:57:46,225 --> 00:57:47,992
It's too late, Saul.

821
00:57:47,994 --> 00:57:50,394
No, please no.

822
00:57:50,396 --> 00:57:53,366
The Amalekites escape!

823
00:57:54,233 --> 00:57:58,304
The kingdom has been torn.

824
00:58:05,078 --> 00:58:08,349
Saul! Saul!
Saul! Saul! Saul!

825
00:58:20,428 --> 00:58:23,031
Have I not brought victory?

826
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:26,402
See how we honor God
with this offering!

827
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,939
You honor yourself!

828
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,944
While you feast, the
Amalekites escape!

829
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,245
Just as they attacked and
killed the weakest of us

830
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:40,250
when we escaped Pharaoh!

831
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:43,588
You have put your entire
people in danger

832
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:45,590
because of your pride.

833
00:58:49,494 --> 00:58:53,398
We will never truly be free
with you on the throne.

834
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:57,135
Don't turn your back on me!

835
00:59:03,008 --> 00:59:05,411
It's too late, Saul.

836
00:59:05,678 --> 00:59:08,981
Today the kingdom has
been torn from you

837
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:11,917
and given to another.

838
00:59:47,023 --> 00:59:48,691
It's you.

839
00:59:57,233 --> 01:00:00,169
It's you Samuel
chose to replace me!

840
01:00:01,237 --> 01:00:02,739
Tell me...

841
01:00:03,072 --> 01:00:05,610
Tell me it isn't so.

842
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:08,078
I, I can't.

843
01:00:08,278 --> 01:00:11,716
I invited you into my home!

844
01:00:11,783 --> 01:00:13,114
My king.

845
01:00:13,116 --> 01:00:15,285
I loved you like a son!

846
01:00:15,452 --> 01:00:18,922
I have done nothing
but serve you.

847
01:00:18,924 --> 01:00:20,891
You are the anointed king.

848
01:00:20,893 --> 01:00:21,892
Jonathan is just.

849
01:00:21,894 --> 01:00:23,762
Don't!

850
01:00:24,195 --> 01:00:26,130
Say it.

851
01:00:27,265 --> 01:00:31,103
Your words, your, your songs,

852
01:00:32,237 --> 01:00:34,473
they have bewitched me!

853
01:00:37,978 --> 01:00:39,779
Go on.

854
01:00:40,346 --> 01:00:44,182
Are you not man enough to
fight me for the throne?

855
01:00:44,184 --> 01:00:45,751
I have never wanted the throne.

856
01:00:45,753 --> 01:00:47,287
Lies!

857
01:00:47,555 --> 01:00:50,457
You have stolen the
hearts of my people.

858
01:00:50,691 --> 01:00:53,792
Even my own family
loves you more than me.

859
01:00:57,099 --> 01:00:59,100
What's left to take

860
01:00:59,968 --> 01:01:01,703
but my crown?

861
01:01:02,537 --> 01:01:05,774
The crown belongs to God.

862
01:01:05,841 --> 01:01:07,543
God!

863
01:01:08,077 --> 01:01:11,280
God has turned his back on me,

864
01:01:12,214 --> 01:01:16,349
and now he has turned
his back on you!

865
01:01:22,225 --> 01:01:25,292
Seize him, he tried to kill me!

866
01:01:25,294 --> 01:01:26,862
Hey, you!

867
01:01:26,864 --> 01:01:28,599
There he is!

868
01:01:28,832 --> 01:01:30,400
- Get him!
- Come back here!

869
01:01:30,601 --> 01:01:31,265
He tried
to kill the king!

870
01:01:31,267 --> 01:01:33,436
Stop!

871
01:01:33,538 --> 01:01:35,203
Father, what happened?

872
01:01:35,205 --> 01:01:37,674
He, he tried to kill me!

873
01:01:37,676 --> 01:01:39,243
Who?

874
01:01:41,278 --> 01:01:42,647
Come back here!

875
01:01:42,947 --> 01:01:44,814
- Stop him!
- Don't let him escape!

876
01:01:44,816 --> 01:01:46,585
Shoot, son, shoot!

877
01:01:46,686 --> 01:01:48,351
Don't
let him get away!

878
01:01:48,353 --> 01:01:50,188
- David?
- David?

879
01:01:51,489 --> 01:01:53,491
It's him, Jonathan.

880
01:01:53,759 --> 01:01:56,927
He's the one Samuel chose
to replace me.

881
01:01:56,929 --> 01:01:58,564
To replace you.

882
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:03,300
A traitor worming his
way into our hearts.

883
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,539
Finish this, now!

884
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:09,574
As long as David lives neither
you nor I will be safe.

885
01:02:09,576 --> 01:02:13,213
The crown belongs to us.

886
01:02:25,828 --> 01:02:27,160
Watch it!

887
01:02:35,704 --> 01:02:38,973
The crown belongs to God.

888
01:02:43,278 --> 01:02:45,347
Farewell, my brother.

889
01:02:46,149 --> 01:02:48,183
Seal off the city.

890
01:02:48,283 --> 01:02:50,353
No one in or out
until he's found.

891
01:02:50,453 --> 01:02:51,385
Don't let him out
of your sights!

892
01:02:51,387 --> 01:02:52,386
Come back here!

893
01:02:52,388 --> 01:02:54,223
There's nowhere to run!

894
01:03:03,034 --> 01:03:04,803
Men. Follow me.

895
01:03:17,784 --> 01:03:19,284
Hey, David!

896
01:03:20,352 --> 01:03:22,855
David, where are you going?

897
01:03:24,123 --> 01:03:25,591
Find him!

898
01:03:25,725 --> 01:03:27,926
Put to the sword
anyone who aids him!

899
01:03:27,928 --> 01:03:29,797
Those loyal to David...

900
01:03:30,463 --> 01:03:32,733
Are disloyal to me!

901
01:03:41,441 --> 01:03:43,109
Find David!

902
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:45,245
He tried to kill Saul!

903
01:03:46,047 --> 01:03:47,549
It's David!

904
01:03:52,086 --> 01:03:53,923
Run, run, hurry!

905
01:03:55,524 --> 01:03:56,592
What's going on?

906
01:03:56,725 --> 01:03:57,758
David
tried to kill Saul!

907
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,594
David? No! Never!

908
01:04:07,938 --> 01:04:08,937
Hey! Thief!

909
01:04:08,939 --> 01:04:10,437
Stop the thief!

910
01:04:12,042 --> 01:04:13,808
- Ugh!
- Hey, watch it!

911
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:15,210
David?

912
01:04:15,212 --> 01:04:16,177
What have you done?

913
01:04:16,179 --> 01:04:17,813
Nothing!

914
01:04:17,815 --> 01:04:20,249
Flush out the traitor!

915
01:04:20,251 --> 01:04:21,250
Where is he?

916
01:04:21,252 --> 01:04:23,020
It doesn't sound like nothing!

917
01:04:24,922 --> 01:04:26,188
Eliab, please.

918
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:28,557
No. This stops tonight.

919
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,360
You've put us all in danger.

920
01:04:30,696 --> 01:04:31,761
If you aren't willing
to do the right thing

921
01:04:31,763 --> 01:04:34,531
to protect our family, I will.

922
01:04:34,533 --> 01:04:36,334
Let go of me.

923
01:04:37,135 --> 01:04:38,602
I need to go.

924
01:04:42,107 --> 01:04:43,776
Follow me.

925
01:04:44,409 --> 01:04:45,879
Run! Run!

926
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:50,882
Where is he?

927
01:04:50,884 --> 01:04:51,916
That way.

928
01:04:55,288 --> 01:04:56,957
What was that?

929
01:04:57,324 --> 01:04:59,994

get our family to safety.

Wakey, wakey!

979
01:09:16,538 --> 01:09:18,103
Definitely dead.

980
01:09:18,105 --> 01:09:19,304
Good.

981
01:09:19,306 --> 01:09:20,741
Okay.

982
01:09:20,974 --> 01:09:22,609
Now don't suddenly
turn out to be alive

983
01:09:22,877 --> 01:09:24,877
while I'm taking your
sandals, alright?

984
01:09:24,879 --> 01:09:26,647

985
01:09:26,649 --> 01:09:28,281
oh, scare the heck out of me.

986
01:09:33,388 --> 01:09:35,925
What did I just say?

987
01:09:38,294 --> 01:09:40,827
Hey, what have
you found, Zaydel?

988
01:09:40,829 --> 01:09:42,965
A not dead enough dead-man.

989
01:09:43,265 --> 01:09:45,165
You robbing
a defenseless man again?

990
01:09:45,167 --> 01:09:48,269
No, I was looting his corpse.

991
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:49,437
Big difference.

992
01:09:50,541 --> 01:09:52,075
It's David!

993
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:55,977
What? What are you doing?

994
01:09:55,979 --> 01:09:57,981
Don't give him stuff!

995
01:09:58,315 --> 01:10:00,317
That's the opposite of
what I'm trying to do.

996
01:10:00,652 --> 01:10:02,920
God favors him today that
we came across his path.

997
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:06,656
God's favor doesn't
look like what I expected.

998
01:10:09,493 --> 01:10:11,095
Help me.

999
01:10:13,999 --> 01:10:17,369
Wait, he's still got
one of my new sandals!

1000
01:10:17,503 --> 01:10:19,071
Ooo!

1001
01:10:37,423 --> 01:10:41,695
Elhanan, Abishai,
what are you doing here?

1002
01:10:42,229 --> 01:10:45,397
Saul didn't take too kindly
to anyone loyal to you.

1003
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:46,932
Or thieves.

1004
01:10:46,934 --> 01:10:48,969
He didn't like them.

1005
01:10:50,839 --> 01:10:52,506
Nice sandals.

1006
01:10:52,508 --> 01:10:53,973
Oh! Thanks!

1007
01:10:53,975 --> 01:10:55,908
I had them for ages.

1008
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:57,979
We're glad you're all right.

1009
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:05,054
Hey you. Huh!

1010
01:11:06,155 --> 01:11:08,155
Come on, the
others will want to see you.

1011
01:11:08,157 --> 01:11:09,725
Others?

1012
01:11:33,084 --> 01:11:35,253
Who are all these people?

1013
01:11:35,386 --> 01:11:37,488
Everyone who's
running from Saul.

1014
01:11:37,556 --> 01:11:39,424
David! Oh!

1015
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:41,059
Ima!

1016
01:11:41,594 --> 01:11:43,860
I missed you so much!

1017
01:11:43,862 --> 01:11:44,729
Is the family safe?

1018
01:11:44,731 --> 01:11:45,862
David!

1019
01:11:45,864 --> 01:11:47,264
Ow!

1020
01:11:47,266 --> 01:11:48,834
Zeruiah!

1021
01:11:49,736 --> 01:11:51,168
You wait until we're kicked out

1022
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:53,538
of the kingdom for a reunion?

1023
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:55,509
You're all here?

1024
01:11:55,975 --> 01:11:57,511
Well, the
house got a bit crowded

1025
01:11:57,611 --> 01:11:59,946
with the soldiers and all.

1026
01:12:03,016 --> 01:12:05,083
Get him some food.

1027
01:12:07,855 --> 01:12:10,690
You come at me with
sword and spear.

1028
01:12:10,692 --> 01:12:12,391
- Ah!
- Ow!

1029
01:12:12,393 --> 01:12:13,961
That's not how a sling works.

1030
01:12:14,061 --> 01:12:15,762
You'll be dead in
a minute, giant.

1031
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,498
Now say your next line!

1032
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:18,931
Hmp!

1033
01:12:18,933 --> 01:12:20,836
Hey! Watch it.

1034
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:30,779
How's your tapestry working out?

1035
01:12:31,614 --> 01:12:35,285
Oh just, you know, way...

1036
01:12:35,586 --> 01:12:37,854
Way worse than I thought!

1037
01:12:38,388 --> 01:12:41,757
I don't feel like
I'm being woven,

1038
01:12:41,759 --> 01:12:43,692
so much as being stabbed!

1039
01:12:44,729 --> 01:12:47,064
Oh I so love you.

1040
01:12:48,499 --> 01:12:50,899
Sometimes a thread
is pulled so tight

1041
01:12:50,901 --> 01:12:52,936
you think it might snap.

1042
01:12:53,605 --> 01:12:55,103
But trust the weaver.

1043
01:12:57,174 --> 01:12:59,444
I feel like I snapped
a while ago, Ima.

1044
01:13:00,345 --> 01:13:03,248
Then trust him to tie
you back together.

1045
01:13:16,897 --> 01:13:21,100
How can you laugh when we
are being hunted by Saul?

1046
01:13:22,234 --> 01:13:24,572
Did you not hear what
he did to the priests?

1047
01:13:29,677 --> 01:13:31,546
That was my fault.

1048
01:13:32,245 --> 01:13:33,746
This is all my fault.

1049
01:13:33,748 --> 01:13:35,146
No, David.

1050
01:13:35,148 --> 01:13:37,285
I didn't understand at first.

1051
01:13:37,519 --> 01:13:40,520
But it's clear our
king has lost his mind.

1052
01:13:40,522 --> 01:13:42,054
Look around you.

1053
01:13:42,056 --> 01:13:44,192
These people are loyal to you.

1054
01:13:44,459 --> 01:13:46,726
It can't be for nothing
that you were anointed.

1055
01:13:46,728 --> 01:13:47,928
Abba!

1056
01:13:49,331 --> 01:13:50,966
- What did he say?
- David anointed?

1057
01:13:51,133 --> 01:13:52,499
- This is crazy!
- What does that mean?

1058
01:13:52,502 --> 01:13:53,967
Is it true?

1059
01:13:53,969 --> 01:13:56,004
It's true!

1060
01:13:56,338 --> 01:13:59,642
The Prophet Samuel
himself came to my house!

1061
01:13:59,676 --> 01:14:01,911
You're the next king?

1062
01:14:10,053 --> 01:14:11,486
Yes.

1063
01:14:12,388 --> 01:14:13,591
- David?
- David? King?

1064
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:15,592
- This is wonderful!
- We could go home!

1065
01:14:15,594 --> 01:14:17,094
Does that come with
a whole lot of money?

1066
01:14:17,394 --> 01:14:19,930
With you as king, we
will at last be free.

1067
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:20,996
Saul won't give up
without a fight.

1068
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:22,199
Civil war then?

1069
01:14:22,366 --> 01:14:23,633
What can we do
against Saul's army?

1070
01:14:23,635 --> 01:14:24,366
Saul must pay for
what he's done.

1071
01:14:24,368 --> 01:14:25,400
David will save us.

1072
01:14:25,402 --> 01:14:27,203
God has chosen David.

1073
01:14:27,205 --> 01:14:29,205
He is God's anointed!

1074
01:14:29,207 --> 01:14:30,406
He is God's anointed.

1075
01:14:30,408 --> 01:14:32,242
He is God's anointed.

1076
01:14:32,244 --> 01:14:34,079
God's anointed.

1077
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,581
He is God's anointed.

1078
01:14:41,855 --> 01:14:43,389
Saul.

1079
01:14:49,262 --> 01:14:50,795
What's wrong, sire?

1080
01:14:50,797 --> 01:14:52,265
N-nothing.

1081
01:14:53,501 --> 01:14:57,137
I just need a moment out
of this wretched sun.

1082
01:14:58,171 --> 01:14:59,641
Of course.

1083
01:15:06,381 --> 01:15:07,415
David will save us!

1084
01:15:07,516 --> 01:15:08,982
Saul must pay for
what he's done!

1085
01:15:08,984 --> 01:15:10,651
We'll gather an army.

1086
01:15:10,653 --> 01:15:11,518
We'll overthrow Gibeah.

1087
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,022
Finally, we'll be free of Saul.

1088
01:15:14,155 --> 01:15:17,559
David is the rightful...

1089
01:15:33,578 --> 01:15:36,413
We will scour the
area while you rest, sire.

1090
01:16:42,685 --> 01:16:46,455
My shadows, these
voices, plaguing me.

1091
01:16:50,459 --> 01:16:52,261
They will not leave me.

1092
01:17:25,197 --> 01:17:26,998
Anything?

1093
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,268
No sign of them, Sire.

1094
01:17:34,808 --> 01:17:36,241
My Lord the king.

1095
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:49,891
Why are you hunting me?

1096
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:58,165
Did God not just deliver
you into my hands?

1097
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:06,709
Some urged me to kill you,

1098
01:18:07,342 --> 01:18:10,680
but I won't lay a hand on you.

1099
01:18:16,053 --> 01:18:17,788
If a Philistine were chasing me

1100
01:18:18,354 --> 01:18:21,892
or an Amalekite was hunting
me down, I'd know what to do.

1101
01:18:22,025 --> 01:18:23,894
I could, I could defend myself.

1102
01:18:24,862 --> 01:18:26,664
But it's you...

1103
01:18:27,699 --> 01:18:29,501
My king.

1104
01:18:35,206 --> 01:18:38,340
I am not trying to
take the throne.

1105
01:18:56,328 --> 01:18:57,327
David I, I.

1106
01:18:57,329 --> 01:18:58,965
I

1107
01:18:59,099 --> 01:19:01,132
I know, I know, it's okay.

1108
01:19:10,077 --> 01:19:11,612
What?

1109
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,509
- David, he did it.
- Finally, fresh air.

1110
01:19:39,642 --> 01:19:42,444
He's leaving,
we can come out.

1111
01:19:44,148 --> 01:19:46,215
- I can go home, thank you.
- Thank you, thank you.

1112
01:19:46,217 --> 01:19:47,616
We must celebrate!

1113
01:19:47,618 --> 01:19:49,019
Don't.

1114
01:19:50,187 --> 01:19:52,422
Eliab.

1115
01:19:52,523 --> 01:19:54,357
Aren't you gonna
follow your king?

1116
01:19:56,427 --> 01:19:58,730
I made a mistake following Saul.

1117
01:20:04,468 --> 01:20:06,671
Show me it's not a
mistake following you.

1118
01:20:09,008 --> 01:20:10,610
Apology accepted.

1119
01:20:10,743 --> 01:20:12,310
Huh.

1120
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,414
He won't stop hunting you.

1121
01:20:18,618 --> 01:20:20,586
There is one place I
know he won't follow.

1122
01:20:38,873 --> 01:20:43,441
Well, I wouldn't say it's homey.

1123
01:20:43,443 --> 01:20:45,947
You sure about this?

1124
01:20:46,215 --> 01:20:48,517
Sure that Saul won't
pursue us here at least.

1125
01:20:48,817 --> 01:20:51,687
I think I'd rather take
my chances with Saul.

1126
01:20:58,394 --> 01:21:00,429
Hmmm...

1127
01:21:03,033 --> 01:21:05,700
It is true, your
most high highness.

1128
01:21:05,702 --> 01:21:07,735
The Israelites are unraveling.

1129
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:10,470
Saul no longer has his champion.

1130
01:21:10,472 --> 01:21:13,110
Marvelous.

1131
01:21:13,611 --> 01:21:16,113
Let's go and pay them
a visit, shall we?

1132
01:21:45,144 --> 01:21:46,913
David, David!

1133
01:21:47,146 --> 01:21:49,581
The Philistines are
marching on Saul!

1134
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:52,019
The largest army I've ever seen!

1135
01:22:41,205 --> 01:22:43,507
Ah, Philistine!

1136
01:22:43,509 --> 01:22:45,207
Ow! Ow!

1137
01:22:45,209 --> 01:22:46,442
Take that!

1138
01:22:46,444 --> 01:22:47,543
Zeruiah, wait.

1139
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:49,180
David?

1140
01:22:49,647 --> 01:22:51,747
Ow! It's good to know
where you land on

1141
01:22:51,749 --> 01:22:53,450
the fight or flight thing.

1142
01:22:53,652 --> 01:22:55,385
Sorry.

1143
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:58,157
So what do you think?

1144
01:22:58,323 --> 01:22:59,556
I think you've lost your mind.

1145
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,960
Ima, Ima, it's me.

1146
01:23:05,765 --> 01:23:08,134
Sorry, instinct.

1147
01:23:08,301 --> 01:23:09,970
David, what on
Earth are you doing?

1148
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:11,738
You could've given
me a heart attack.

1149
01:23:11,971 --> 01:23:14,038
The Philistines are
marching on Saul.

1150
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,673
We will infiltrate their army

1151
01:23:15,675 --> 01:23:17,978
and turn on them as they attack.

1152
01:23:18,211 --> 01:23:19,981
When we deliver this
victory for Saul,

1153
01:23:20,281 --> 01:23:24,518
he will know without a
doubt that I am for him.

1154
01:23:24,752 --> 01:23:27,154
Everything will be
back the way it was.

1155
01:23:27,922 --> 01:23:29,922
The people are divided, David.

1156
01:23:29,924 --> 01:23:31,691
Samuel said we'd
be vulnerable if

1157
01:23:31,693 --> 01:23:34,794
I'm trying to reunite us.

1158
01:23:34,796 --> 01:23:37,032
Is that so wrong?

1159
01:23:39,601 --> 01:23:42,135
I will not just
leave Saul to die.

1160
01:24:11,402 --> 01:24:13,002
Quit that.

1161
01:24:13,004 --> 01:24:14,539
Okay.

1162
01:24:17,742 --> 01:24:19,909
That's a big army.

1163
01:24:19,911 --> 01:24:21,746
Their numbers don't matter.

1164
01:24:22,148 --> 01:24:24,748
We just have to get to King
Achish and his generals

1165
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:26,652
and the army will collapse.

1166
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:56,682
Saul, we heard you
lost your champion.

1167
01:24:56,684 --> 01:24:58,953
It's time for a rematch.

1168
01:25:01,591 --> 01:25:03,591
A rider approaches.

1169
01:25:16,072 --> 01:25:17,738
Where is your father?

1170
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:20,107
Afraid to face us, is he?

1171
01:25:20,109 --> 01:25:22,212
He's tired of your talk Achish.

1172
01:25:24,047 --> 01:25:26,649
Does it look like
we've come to talk?

1173
01:25:26,651 --> 01:25:28,385
I thought we had come to talk.

1174
01:25:28,852 --> 01:25:31,386
Well, yes to talk
now, but then battle.

1175
01:25:31,388 --> 01:25:32,421
Now I'm with you.

1176
01:25:32,423 --> 01:25:33,556
Enough talk.

1177
01:25:33,558 --> 01:25:35,326
We haven't come to talk!

1178
01:25:35,627 --> 01:25:38,061
We outnumber your
army 10 to one.

1179
01:25:38,063 --> 01:25:40,932
Where is the God of Israel now?

1180
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:44,870
Right here, and He
has you doing His will.

1181
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:46,202
What do you mean?

1182
01:25:46,204 --> 01:25:47,939
I am not afraid.

1183
01:25:48,206 --> 01:25:51,076
If we win, then it
will be by God's hand.

1184
01:25:52,345 --> 01:25:56,315
If not, today you are
putting David on the throne.

1185
01:25:57,850 --> 01:26:00,987
Either way, you lose.

1186
01:26:03,323 --> 01:26:06,793
Get back here, we
are not done talking!

1187
01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:08,829
I thought
you hadn't come to talk.

1188
01:26:29,251 --> 01:26:31,220
- Come on men.
- What did they say?

1189
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:37,126
They're quaking in their boots.

1190
01:26:39,895 --> 01:26:41,463
I'm.

1191
01:26:43,166 --> 01:26:45,835
I'm sorry I brought this on you.

1192
01:26:48,506 --> 01:26:50,305
I would rather be
here by your side,

1193
01:26:50,307 --> 01:26:52,075
than have you face this alone.

1194
01:26:53,243 --> 01:26:54,946
Black smoke.

1195
01:26:59,984 --> 01:27:02,053
Look, black smoke.

1196
01:27:02,486 --> 01:27:05,854
The Amalekites must have
found some unfortunate people.

1197
01:27:05,856 --> 01:27:07,692
Isn't that coming from Ziklag?

1198
01:27:12,632 --> 01:27:13,664
We have to go back.

1199
01:27:13,666 --> 01:27:15,965
Our families.

1200
01:27:15,967 --> 01:27:19,071
Oh, this is good, very good.

1201
01:27:19,339 --> 01:27:21,939
Did they not wonder why
we abandoned that city?

1202
01:27:21,941 --> 01:27:23,443
Anyway, no matter.

1203
01:27:23,976 --> 01:27:26,511
Looks like the Amalekites are
taking care of them for us.

1204
01:27:27,815 --> 01:27:29,080
No.

1205
01:27:31,852 --> 01:27:35,688
Well, come on, charge!

1206
01:27:46,868 --> 01:27:49,302
For God and honor!

1207
01:27:54,976 --> 01:27:56,442
We shouldn't have left them.

1208
01:27:56,444 --> 01:27:58,879
Our families, we
have to go back.

1209
01:28:51,772 --> 01:28:53,340
Where are they?

1210
01:28:57,645 --> 01:28:59,212
My children.

1211
01:29:03,718 --> 01:29:05,587
They've been taken.

1212
01:29:14,797 --> 01:29:16,398
Why God, why?

1213
01:29:16,933 --> 01:29:18,501
Why?

1214
01:29:41,593 --> 01:29:42,758
This
is David's fault!

1215
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:43,860
Our families.

1216
01:29:43,862 --> 01:29:45,595
We believed in you!

1217
01:29:45,597 --> 01:29:47,295
It wasn't safe.

1218
01:29:47,297 --> 01:29:49,333
You had the chance to
kill Saul at the cave.

1219
01:29:49,601 --> 01:29:50,733
- Where is God now?
- We shouldn't have

1220
01:29:50,735 --> 01:29:52,001
left them alone!

1221
01:29:52,003 --> 01:29:54,872
Why did I trust you?

1222
01:30:09,088 --> 01:30:09,888
Remember when I told you.

1223
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:11,490
God had big plans for you?

1224
01:30:12,659 --> 01:30:14,594
They may have been bigger
than even I thought.

1225
01:30:17,732 --> 01:30:20,701
Today you are
putting David on the throne.

1226
01:30:24,939 --> 01:30:26,437
Our true battle

1227
01:30:26,439 --> 01:30:28,406
is not against flesh and blood,

1228
01:30:28,408 --> 01:30:30,411
but in our hearts.

1229
01:31:00,044 --> 01:31:01,645
What do you want from me?

1230
01:31:03,479 --> 01:31:05,616
I'm
just a shepherd.

1231
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:09,752
A shepherd is
precisely who they need

1232
01:31:09,754 --> 01:31:13,525
to lead them back home.

1233
01:31:34,781 --> 01:31:36,148
Where are you going?

1234
01:31:36,917 --> 01:31:38,583
To bring our people home.

1235
01:31:38,585 --> 01:31:40,721
The Amalekites will kill you.

1236
01:31:42,089 --> 01:31:44,056
I'm a shepherd, Eliab.

1237
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:46,260
What can I do but
look after my sheep?

1238
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:50,497
And I trust my shepherd
to look after me.

1239
01:31:53,935 --> 01:31:55,469
What if he doesn't?

1240
01:31:57,639 --> 01:31:59,808
I'd rather take my
chances following the light,

1241
01:31:59,942 --> 01:32:02,310
than choose to live in the dark.

1242
01:32:04,412 --> 01:32:06,347
Which do you choose, Eliab?

1243
01:32:25,836 --> 01:32:27,370
Move.

1244
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:31,073
You are cowards!

1245
01:32:35,311 --> 01:32:37,312
Scavengers.

1246
01:32:37,314 --> 01:32:41,751
Kings fight, sheep scatter.

1247
01:32:41,753 --> 01:32:43,689
We collect.

1248
01:32:44,156 --> 01:32:46,388
David will come.

1249
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:48,527
He will rescue us.

1250
01:32:55,635 --> 01:32:57,135

1251

He's alone?

1261
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:33,441
You are
foolish to come alone.

1262
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:36,579
Does it look like I'm alone?

1263
01:33:37,213 --> 01:33:40,483
My people are right here

1264
01:33:40,751 --> 01:33:43,184
and I've come to show
them the way home.

1265
01:33:43,186 --> 01:33:44,185
What did he say?

1266
01:33:44,187 --> 01:33:45,856
Why won't he fight?

1267
01:33:46,489 --> 01:33:48,391
When I fought Goliath,

1268
01:33:48,558 --> 01:33:50,894
it wasn't a boy standing
against a giant.

1269
01:33:52,395 --> 01:33:55,064
It was a giant standing
against the maker

1270
01:33:55,066 --> 01:33:57,234
of heaven and earth.

1271
01:33:59,003 --> 01:34:00,605
So stand.

1272
01:34:02,006 --> 01:34:03,908
You aren't alone.

1273
01:34:04,943 --> 01:34:06,545
- But I'm scared.
- We can't.

1274
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:09,882
I know you're scared,

1275
01:34:10,314 --> 01:34:12,350
but I don't see a
bunch of scared people.

1276
01:34:13,685 --> 01:34:15,919
I see mighty men and
women....

1277
01:34:16,354 --> 01:34:17,923
No!

1278
01:34:21,426 --> 01:34:23,161
I see slaves.

1279
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:25,196
No, let me go.

1280
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:27,098
He's my boy, please.

1281
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:28,702
Take me instead.

1282
01:34:30,104 --> 01:34:32,540
This can't be happening.

1283
01:34:36,944 --> 01:34:38,546
No.

1284
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:41,549
No.
