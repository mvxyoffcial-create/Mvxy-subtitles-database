Are you okay?

00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,422
Yeah.
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

17
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,658
Here, let me help you.

18
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,664
Uh...

19
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,834
Sorry about all this.

20
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,470
- Sure, okay.
- I got it.

21
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,839
The latch is broken.

00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,541
Shoot, that's my bus.

00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:59,712
Hey. Hey, hey! Wait!

24
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:05,984
Hang on, I got it.
Oh, fuck.

25
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,355
You can just...
Sorry.

26
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,300
Well, I'm officially
an asshole.

27
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,801
Where were you heading?

28
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,169
The city.

29
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,171
Where were you going?

30
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,740
Just up the pass.

31
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:31,977
I guess
it wasn't meant to be.

32
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,580
So what are you gonna do?

33
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,583
Can just head back
into town, I guess.

34
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,290
What's it called?

35
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,593
Silent Hill.

36
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,462
There's a trail down that way.

37
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:51,597
Cool.

38
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,733
What's that down there
on the water?

39
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,037
That's the Lakeview.

40
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,772
It's a hotel.

41
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:04,209
The view of the lake
from the rooftop is so pretty.

42
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,179
Pretty enough
they named a hotel after it?

43
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,280
You nearly run me down,

44
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,116
and now you're giving me
a hard time?

45
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,719
Yeah, shit. Sorry. Um...

46
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,388
I deserved that, didn't I?

47
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,691
Mm. I'm James, by the way.

48
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,592
Mary.

49
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,894
Well, like, seriously, Mary,
let me drive you home.

50
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,397
I can save you
a sprained ankle or two.

51
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,966
I don't even know you, James.

52
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,569
All right. Well, I'm just
gonna have to stand here,

53
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,071
watch you go down,
make sure you don't fall.

54
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,273
Seems like
appropriate penance

55
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,174
for screwing up my day.

56
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,387
So, are you coming or what?

57
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,794
Silent Hill summer storm.

58
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,196
Doesn't happen often.

59
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,932
But when it does...

60
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,529
Think it's time to go.

61
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,933
All right. All right.

62
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,135
Jesus!

63
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,537
Sorry. That's on me.

64
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,940
Let's go, asshole.

65
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,853
- Get outta here.
- Let's go. Let's go.

66
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,921
Yeah? Come on!

67
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,190
Come on!

68
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,326
Yo, get the fuck off me!

69
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,763
Let go of me!

70
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,599
Fuck you! Fuck you!

71
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,203
Nighty night, fucker.

72
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,320
There you are.

73
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,823
How are you?

74
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,192
Not so great.

75
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,694
You've been drinking.

76
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,532
It felt like we were moving
in the right direction, James.

77
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,333
I know.

78
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,636
[over phone] You've got
to stop beating yourself up.

79
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,739
Here's what I need you to do.

80
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,642
Get home, drink some water,
get some sleep.

81
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,612
Reset and come
to our appointment tomorrow.

82
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:31,918
Yeah, tomorrow.
Yeah. Okay.

83
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,787
We'll see.

84
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,706
Oh, God.

85
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:09,881
James,
so much time has passed.

86
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,550
I know that.

87
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,018
But I'm asking--

88
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,922
I'm begging you
to please come back.

89
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,925
To our place.

90
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,961
Something's happened.

91
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:26,198
Please, James. I need you.

92
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,137
Love, Mary.

93
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,580
Jesus.

94
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,928
It's her.

95
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,368
It's always been her.

96
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,805
Mary.

97
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,244
The girl of my dreams.

98
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,681
The love of my life.

99
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,396
Our place.

100
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,105
Our town.

101
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,345
Our love.

102
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,485
It was here.

103
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,192
It was everywhere.

104
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,237
And now, they keep telling me
to let go.

105
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,242
To move on.

106
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,117
But how can I ever do that?

107
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,358
When you're calling me?

108
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,500
Hello?

109
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,903
Grab a bag.

110
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,206
What?

111
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,413
Careful.

112
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,582
They're heavy.

113
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,419
So, where's all this
coming from?

114
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,421
This?

115
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,489
You mean the ashes?

116
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,358
Yeah.

117
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,828
It started with
the fires in the summer.

118
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,598
Tore through the forests.

119
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,034
Some are still burning.

120
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,837
And then came the rains.

121
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,939
Right.

122
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,408
So, there's someone...

123
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,212
someone I care about,
and I need to find her.

124
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,115
You won't.

125
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,352
Floods overran
the water treatment plant.

126
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,820
When water
gets contaminated,

127
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,322
people don't stick around.

128
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,524
Look, I'm still going to try
and head into town

129
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,994
if you could just...

130
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,832
Well...

131
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,634
thanks, anyway.

132
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,903
Wait.

133
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,906
You don't find
who you're looking for,

134
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,342
you can always
come back and find me.

135
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,411
I'm Angela.

136
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,712
Angela.

137
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,048
Sure.

138
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:44,409
So, what if I...

139
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,544
moved here?

140
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,048
No museums. No clubs.

141
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,549
Zero anonymity.

142
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,953
Yeah, I'm just
as shocked as you are.

143
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,654
You'd really
want to move here?

144
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,323
I would.

145
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,257
Why?

146
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,226
Well, there's this girl.

147
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:06,097
And she's not much
to look at, but.

148
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:10,601
What?

149
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:13,104
You don't think we're ready
to live together?

150
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,541
There are parts of me
you haven't seen.

151
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,544
What if who I am scares you?

152
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,046
It won't.

153
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,716
I promise you.

154
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,360
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

155
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,961
Hey now, now tilt
your head back.

156
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,265
I can't believe this.

157
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,334
It's okay. I got you.

158
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,138
I'm here.
I'll always be here.

159
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,441
I mean it.

160
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,084
I don't understand.

161
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,403
This is insane.

162
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,626
Hello?!

163
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,863
Can anyone hear me?

164
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,871
Is someone there?

165
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,075
Hello?

166
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,898
Hello?

167
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,503
Can you hear me?

168
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:26,290
They're coming back.

169
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,693
- Who?
- You know they're coming back.

170
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,462
All that darkness,
you can't keep it away.

171
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,798
Just-just-just
get off me, all right?

172
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:47,078
I wasn't expecting
a no-show, James.

173
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,479
I'm in Silent Hill.

174
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,614
[over phone] What?

175
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,415
I did--something's
happened here.

176
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,384
Something really, really bad.

177
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,452
James.

178
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,153
Listen to me carefully.

179
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,089
This is getting out of control.

180
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,690
I need to go home...

181
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,192
to Mary.

182
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,893
What did you say?

183
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,362
I need you to come back.

184
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,264
There's no home
for you there anymore.

185
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,434
James?

186
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,270
James?

187
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,223
Everyone...

188
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:07,224
this is James.

189
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,025
Hi.

190
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,227
So Mary tells me
you're an artist.

191
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,696
Yeah. Painter.

192
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,433
And you have
the perfect muse.

193
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,602
Our Mary,
she's something special.

194
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,706
Sparkling little apple
of her father's eye.

195
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,808
Oh, so you all know him, or...?

196
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,177
Know him?

197
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,079
Joshua Crane.

198
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,881
Doesn't quite do it justice
when you say it out loud.

199
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,516
He changed our lives.

200
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,118
Mary's family,

201
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,419
they built this town.

202
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,921
Gave us purpose.

203
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:41,025
My life was spinning out
in all directions.

204
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,928
Helped me put my head
back on straight.

205
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,664
I think we all
have a similar story.

206
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,531
Mm.

207
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:51,535
We have a way of seeing things
here in Silent Hill.

208
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,437
But don't worry.

209
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,807
I'm sure
we'll find a place for you.

210
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,620
What is that?

211
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,473
Who is that?!

212
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:12,049
This is the Silent Hill
Emergency Operations System.

213
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,452
This is not a test.

214
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,720
City officials have issued
a health emergency

215
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,356
for the city of Silent Hill
and surrounding areas.

216
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:20,591
Residents are being ordered

217
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,161
to evacuate this
area immediately.

218
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,932
I repeat, this is not a test.

219
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,000
What you are hearing
is not a test.

220
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:32,136
This is the emergency
alert system.

221
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:35,973
Civil authorities are issuing--

222
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,712
James.

223
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,216
Mary?

224
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,992
Hello, handsome.

225
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,361
How many times you get lost
this time around?

226
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,397
I just can't believe
how much stuff I had.

227
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,598
Come on, one last push.

228
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,834
Um-hmm.

229
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,671
Let me help you with this.

230
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,905
Ooh, why thank you.

231
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,842
You're so welcome.

232
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,004
Where are you?

233
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,507
It hurts so bad.
I can't...

234
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,309
I can't make it stop.

235
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,011
It's gonna be okay.
Just tell me where you are.

236
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,813
No. No.

237
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,415
No, I can feel her.

238
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,017
She's close.

239
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,419
I think she's--

240
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,423
James? James?

241
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,524
The mailbox is full

242
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:36,793
and cannot accept
any messages at this time.

243
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,829
Goodbye.

244
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,841
Hello?

245
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,342
It's me.

246
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,845
Yes. One of my patients
who's broken protocol,

247
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,546
I need a wellness check.

248
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,115
Which patient?

249
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,616
James Sunderland.

250
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,018
Is he a danger
to himself or anyone?

251
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,520
I wouldn't say dangerous but...

252
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,522
he's in trouble.

253
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,322
Mare?

254
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,669
We understand completely
how you feel.

255
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,375
Love is not an easy thing.

256
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,947
You can get your head
all twisted around.

257
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:39,050
You can lose
yourself in it.

258
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,290
But we need to stay focused.

259
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,698
And here he is.
The man of the house.

260
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,069
What's going on, Jimmy boy?

261
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:00,470
What's going on here?

262
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:19,056
Okay. What the fuck was that?

263
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,857
I'm sorry.
They just showed up.

264
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:21,858
Wait, they just showed up?

265
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,460
Twenty people
just showed up?

266
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,962
Again?
They're fucking weird, Mary.

267
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:29,066
They're my family, James.

268
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,736
They took me in
after my father died.

269
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,441
All right.

270
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,718
Is that him?

271
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,767
Please, James...

272
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,469
Please.

273
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,705
I want this to be
about you and me.

274
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,175
Always.

275
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,412
Always just us.

276
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,775
Brookhaven Hospital?

277
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,291
What the fuck?

278
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,292
Are you okay?

279
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,461
It look like I'm okay?

280
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,863
Who the hell are you?

281
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:09,366
I'm-I'm James. I'm--

282
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:12,435
Wait, why are you not sick
like everyone else?

283
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:16,239
What? No, I'm-I'm looking
for someone.

284
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,240
Ain't nobody here.

285
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,575
No, they're at the hospital.

286
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,947
What's funny?

287
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,682
Look around, buddy.

288
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,851
Won't find anyone
at the hospital.

289
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,188
City's one big cemetery.

290
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,190
Oh, God.
What is happening?

291
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,058
You should have seen it.

292
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:38,161
No one could get their ass
in gear to react in time.

293
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,396
Poor fucks.

294
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,399
Whole town was rotten
before anyways, but this,

295
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,367
this was something else.

296
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,203
The fires...

297
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,104
the water...

298
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,173
everybody going insane,

299
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,442
bleeding to death
out on the streets.

300
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,344
All that crazy shit happened,

301
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,146
and then these things
start to show up.

302
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:01,551
Wow.

303
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,553
You've been lucky so far.

304
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,589
What?

305
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,757
Check this.

306
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:08,892
Jesus Christ.

307
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,764
So, what is it you do?

308
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:15,966
What do you mean,
what do I do?

309
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:16,967
In life. What do you do?

310
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,001
I'm a--I'm a painter.

311
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,502
A painter, huh?

312
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:22,105
I ever heard of you?

313
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,341
I really don't know.

314
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,311
Always thought I had
the goods to be an artist.

315
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,614
You ever have weird dreams?

316
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:37,387
The shit that goes on in there,
you couldn't handle it.

317
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:42,192
Do you hear that?

318
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,560
Hear what?

319
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,195
Sounds like a baby.

320
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,496
A baby?

321
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,832
There ain't no baby here.

322
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,738
Can I ask a question?

323
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,740
Why would you stay here?

324
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:57,707
You kidding?

325
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,410
Place is rid of
all these assholes.

326
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,012
It's heaven now.

327
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,914
Got the entire city to myself.

328
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,485
There...

329
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,889
What the hell is this?

330
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,559
Holy shit.

331
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,461
Uh-uh, be careful.

332
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,464
What are you talking about?
It's just a kid.

333
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:24,968
Hey, what's your name?
I'm James.

334
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:25,969
And this is--

335
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,004
Eddie.

336
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,006
I'm Laura.

337
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:31,708
Laura?

338
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,877
Oh, you can't just stay in there
all by yourself, Laura.

339
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,211
Come on. I think
you might be small enough

340
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,680
to get through these bars.

341
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:37,480
Come on.

342
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,481
Let's get out of here.

343
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,017
Come on, it's okay.
You can trust me.

344
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,519
You can trust me. Come on.

345
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,387
I'm telling you,
this is a bad idea.

346
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,588
Come on, Laura.

347
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,458
I got you. Come on.
We can help you.

348
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,597
We need to get
our asses outta here.

349
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:55,699
Come on, Laura.
It's all right.

350
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,500
We're not gonna leave
without you. Come on.

351
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,501
Just a bit closer.

352
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,502
Come on, Laura.

353
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,503
Come on.

354
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,472
Jimmy, let's go!

355
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,913
Would you look at that?

356
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:13,183
You're all fucked up
like everyone else.

357
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,521
Get lost, kid!

358
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,524
Why would you do that,
you asshole?!

359
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,430
What is it you called me
again, Jimmy boy?

360
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,033
An asshole?!

361
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,103
Oh, shit.

362
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,472
You did it, didn't ya, Jimmy?

363
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,841
You woke him up.

364
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:41,539
Mary?

365
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,239
What is going on here?

366
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:13,377
I told you not to come.

367
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,412
There are secrets buried here.

368
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:17,880
They need to stay that way.

369
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,384
What secrets? What secrets?

370
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:23,821
What you're doing...

371
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,590
it won't be enough to save her.

372
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:30,293
You can't save her, James.

373
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:31,994
What do you mean, save her?
Save her from what?

374
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,196
Stay where you are!

375
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,998
Wait, wait. I'm not
trying to hurt you. I...

376
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:36,899
Please...

377
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,804
You don't know what kind of
hell you have to face.

378
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,873
I didn't leave.

379
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,209
None of us left!

380
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,611
Don't touch me!

381
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:50,748
No one will touch me again!

382
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,117
Go.

383
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,919
Just go.

384
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,111
Shh. You don't have to cry.

385
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,814
I'm right here.
You're gonna be okay.

386
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,516
Hey.

387
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:28,418
It's Laura, right?

388
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,256
How did you get yourself
up there?

389
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:36,492
He was crawling
on the ground.

390
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:37,693
Who was?

391
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:38,996
A monster!

392
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,699
I was very scared.
But I didn't cry.

393
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,700
Catch me!

394
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,103
What?

395
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,710
What is that?

396
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,679
Show me your doll.

397
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,781
Mary gave it to me.

398
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,516
What?

399
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,218
What did you just say?

400
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,520
Who gave you the doll, Laura?

401
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:05,621
Mary.

402
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:08,024
Mary? Mary Crane?

403
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,726
That's him!

404
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:11,727
What?

405
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:13,130
Hey! Laura?

406
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,109
Laura, wait!

407
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,355
Stop, please!

408
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,107
Laura?

409
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,010
Laura!

410
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,136
Laura?

411
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:32,910
I've been watching you.

412
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,246
You're not from here, are you?

413
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,015
I'm just looking
for this kid.

414
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,984
She's all on her own.

415
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,954
What?

416
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:47,390
Are you just gonna
keep on staring,

417
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,725
or are you going
to say something?

418
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:50,826
Sorry.

419
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:52,461
So...

420
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:53,896
what's your plan?

421
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,631
My plan? Plan for what?

422
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:57,233
For getting us
the hell out of this place?

423
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,402
No, I'm not leaving.
I'm looking for the hospital.

424
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:00,236
Why?

425
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:02,004
Because my girlfriend's there.

426
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:04,340
Everyone got sick
in Silent Hill.

427
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:07,144
How long has your girlfriend
been in the hospital for?

428
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:11,213
I'm-I'm not sure.

429
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,016
I thought you said
she was your girlfriend.

430
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,318
We've been apart.

431
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,752
So, she was
your girlfriend?

432
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,054
Look, I just need to find her.

433
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,422
All right.

434
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:20,823
Got it.

435
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:22,626
Let's find her then.

436
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,967
Just wanted to make sure
you were real.

437
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,339
I don't get it.
Why are you helping me?

438
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,141
You're the first normal
person I've met in weeks.

439
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,111
Strength in numbers.

440
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,113
You don't look like
you've been here weeks.

441
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:45,748
Why, thank you.

442
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,917
You, on the other hand...

443
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:49,752
What?

444
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:52,555
You look fucked.

445
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,426
Shit. Come on.

446
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:59,161
- What?
- Every time this thing goes off,

447
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,629
something's getting close.

448
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:01,897
Come on.
- What?

449
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:04,734
Shit. Come on.
Quick, this way.

450
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:10,707
Shh. Hide, hide, hide.

451
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:46,188
James!

452
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,090
Hey, hey. You all right?

453
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:49,992
Yeah, yeah.

454
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,360
We need to go.

455
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:52,862
The hospital's close.

456
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,431
Everything's dead.

457
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:37,673
So, walk me through this.

458
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:40,909
You're looking for your
kind-of girlfriend.

459
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,479
That's right.

460
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,849
And how long has it been
since you've seen her?

461
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:49,618
I'm not sure.

462
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,722
And we're sure
she's still your girlfriend?

463
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,392
What?

464
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:59,495
A girl can get into
a lot of trouble in this town.

465
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:00,562
Where are you going?

466
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,564
Need to stretch my legs.

467
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,744
Toxicology unit.

468
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:17,913
I think I found her.

469
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,315
Patient admitted at noon

470
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,083
after collapsing in the street.

471
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:23,619
On admission, she presented
with severe anemia,

472
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,421
high-grade fever,
and significant

473
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:27,690
subconjunctival
and nasal hemorrhaging.

474
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,693
Initial blood work revealed
critically low platelet levels,

475
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:34,029
likely due to exposure
to an unidentified substance.

476
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,097
Fever since resolved,

477
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,834
patient remains stable
but physically weakened.

478
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:41,338
Miss,
do you remember your name?

479
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:44,073
Mary.

480
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,507
Mary Crane.

481
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:48,912
There were rumors.

482
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,116
There was this
religious group,

483
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:57,486
old-school
Silent Hill crazies.

484
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:00,723
Founded by this preacher
named Joshua Crane.

485
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:03,392
Even after he died,
they used to worship him

486
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:07,429
as some kind of prophet or God.

487
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,799
And his daughter,
they would...

488
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,800
Wait.

489
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:13,937
She's who you're looking for,
isn't she?

490
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:25,214
Miss Crane,

491
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:28,718
this drug that they've been
giving you all these years...

492
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,859
It made me feel whole.

493
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,763
It made me feel part of them.

494
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:47,736
Mary?!

495
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,806
It's killed your free will.

496
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:55,144
Mary!

497
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:57,012
And it's caused permanent damage

498
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:58,114
to your body.

499
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,518
Leave her alone!

500
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:04,987
They loved me.

501
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:06,422
I thought they did.

502
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:10,592
What was his
is now ours.

503
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,463
What was his is now ours.
- Mary!

504
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:21,171
My blood.

505
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:31,448
All this blood wasn't mine?

506
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:03,947
Let's go!

507
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:06,649
- What?
- Go!

508
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,936
We've gotta find her.

509
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:29,605
Now.

510
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,941
Come on.

511
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,158
Come on!

512
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,583
Come on, come on.

513
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:51,420
Here.

514
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:20,649
James!

515
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:45,808
Help.

516
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:48,911
Here. Let me see.

517
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,382
Oh, no.

518
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:55,177
You can say it.

519
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:56,946
What?

520
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,382
I look just like her.

521
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:05,087
No. No, no, no.
How would you know that?

522
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:07,756
It's how you look at me.

523
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:14,763
Look, I'm gonna go upstairs.
I want you to stay here.

524
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:15,897
No, don't leave me.

525
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:16,998
You'll be safer here.

526
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:19,401
I'm gonna look for Mary,
and I'll come right back.

527
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,703
Promise me something.

528
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:24,506
If you find out she's gone,
we leave.

529
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:25,807
Together.

530
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:27,410
We don't look back.

531
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,192
Who is she?

532
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:49,499
Just someone
I'm trying to help.

533
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:58,106
Now, Laura, you have to
tell me where Mary is.

534
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,908
Doesn't look like
you want to find her.

535
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:03,712
No, I do.
It's all I want.

536
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:07,015
Now, please, where is she?

537
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:08,517
My baby's sad!

538
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:20,529
He's cold and sad.

539
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,298
Sad because nobody loved him.

540
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,300
Just like Mary.

541
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,068
What?

542
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:31,007
You left her all
alone!

543
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:35,010
Ah!

544
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:37,814
You have to get to her
before it's too late.

545
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,120
No, wait! Laura!

546
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:46,522
Laura!

547
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:08,009
Why are you doing this?

548
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,879
No one said
it would be easy.

549
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:22,358
No.

550
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:30,432
What?

551
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:31,968
Laura?

552
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:37,373
Laura?!

553
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:39,507
Laura?!

554
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:41,210
Laura, open the door!

555
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:45,714
Open the door!

556
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:30,993
Why'd you come, James?

557
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,134
What did you think you'd find?

558
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,255
Mary.

559
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:24,045
Come back
when you're ready, James.

560
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:28,450
Mr. Sunderland?

561
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:30,352
Are you with us, Mr. Sunderland?

562
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:33,855
What?

563
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:36,858
What's going on?
Where am I?

564
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:38,159
Where am I?

565
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,561
Brookhaven Hospital.

566
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:41,030
Silent Hill.

567
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:45,533
Where is she?

568
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:46,534
Where is who?

569
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,003
Mary. Mary Crane.

570
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,441
What?

571
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:58,646
Hello, James.

572
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:02,418
I know where she is.

573
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:07,555
You need to let go of her.

574
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:09,025
She's gone.

575
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,029
She's dead, James.

576
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:18,066
She's been dead
for months now.

577
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:20,069
You know that.

578
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:27,142
Why would you say that?

579
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,148
We've got a lot
of serious work to do.

580
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:34,683
But we'll get you through it.

581
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,454
You just have to
promise me something.

582
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:43,658
You need to want to
see yourself get better

583
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,461
as much as I do.

584
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:42,118
Why are you
sitting in the dark?

585
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:46,921
Pack your things.

586
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:49,357
I want us out of here.

587
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:51,560
Why are you acting like this?

588
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:54,864
Guess what I did today.

589
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:59,168
I saw this girl
across the street...

590
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,737
so I followed her.

591
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:04,139
Stop.

592
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,574
I went down this long
flight of stairs.

593
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:07,976
Stop.

594
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,812
And I saw these monsters.

595
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,480
I saw them tear her apart.

596
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:15,284
Just stop!

597
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,723
How long?

598
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,425
Since I was a girl.

599
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:28,730
Why would your father
do this to you?

600
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:29,832
I don't know.

601
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:33,169
I never had a choice.

602
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:37,439
This is your last chance.

603
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:41,276
Walk out that door with me now.

604
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:42,377
Not when you're like this.

605
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:44,779
What am I like?

606
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,781
Scared.

607
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:48,583
You think I'm scared?

608
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:50,652
I am not scared!

609
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:53,388
I am not scared of any of you.

610
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:58,293
But you're disgusted.

611
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:00,361
Say it.

612
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,831
Say I'm disgusting to you.
Say it!

613
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:09,103
That day, I was leaving.

614
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:11,674
I was leaving,
and then you showed up.

615
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:17,178
Why-why didn't you
just tell me?

616
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:19,481
Because I knew you'd walk away.

617
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:24,185
I see the way
you're looking at me.

618
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:26,788
That'll never change now.

619
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:31,492
I told you there were things.
You-you promised me.

620
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,317
How is he today?

621
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:30,919
Calm, I guess.

622
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:36,391
I've worked with vets,
all kinds of trauma,

623
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:40,295
but this is different.
He won't let me in at all.

624
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:42,196
How long have you been
treating him?

625
01:11:42,197 --> 01:11:44,333
Almost a year.

626
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,402
But it's gotten worse.

627
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:52,307
That woman, Mary,
she was everything to him.

628
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,408
Since her lost her,

629
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:56,077
it's like he lost
his grip on reality,

630
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:58,747
and his desire to regain it.

631
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,519
Mary died after their breakup.

632
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:06,888
And he just won't accept it.

633
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:18,434
It's good to see you up, James.

634
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,837
How are you feeling today?

635
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:26,008
James?

636
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,614
I just wish...

637
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:36,452
I wish I hadn't let her down.

638
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:42,358
You're blaming yourself, but...

639
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:47,128
all this chaos in your mind...

640
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:50,431
it's not real.

641
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:56,337
It’s not real,
and it almost destroyed you.

642
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:58,506
We can still fix this.

643
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:01,377
But it's got to be
your decision.

644
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:09,852
Thank you.
For everything.

645
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,942
You didn't find her?

646
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:15,651
Then we can leave.
Together.

647
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:22,524
You promised, James.

648
01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:31,934
You look just like her.

649
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:36,472
I never told you my name.

650
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,643
It's Maria.

651
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:58,259
Or we can stay here together...

652
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:00,528
if you want.

653
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:02,164
Just us.

654
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:10,539
What is it?

655
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,443
Where are you going?

656
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:22,049
James.

657
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,519
Wait for me.

658
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:26,889
You won't find her down there.

659
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:36,932
Please.

660
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,551
Why are you doing this?

661
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:04,159
You were free of all this pain.

662
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:10,899
James!

663
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,206
James!

664
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:20,676
James!

665
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:23,477
James!

666
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:36,158
You can't go in there.

667
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:55,944
Let's go back.

668
01:16:57,879 --> 01:16:59,815
We can still go back.

669
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:06,188
Please don't go any further.

670
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,908
It's over
if you want it to be.

671
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:34,683
Mary's not dead.

672
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:37,319
Not to me.

673
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:40,822
And you're not real.

674
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:44,492
You're just in my way.

675
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:45,760
No.

676
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,928
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

677
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:49,665
Look at me, James.

678
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:54,068
Goodbye, Maria.

679
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:32,260
You're finally here.

680
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:35,362
Laura?

681
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:48,944
I'm not playing
anymore, Laura.

682
01:20:50,745 --> 01:20:52,848
Do you think
you're ready to face it?

683
01:20:57,385 --> 01:21:00,521
Do you think
you're ready to face us?

684
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:15,135
Why are you
doing this to me?

685
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:17,105
To help you remember.

686
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,674
What's her name?

687
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:21,976
What?

688
01:21:21,977 --> 01:21:23,010
Think, James.

689
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,250
What's Mary's full name?

690
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,356
Our full name, James...

691
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,902
It's time now.

692
01:21:53,108 --> 01:21:56,544
And now,
there's nothing left to hide.

693
01:22:22,837 --> 01:22:25,039
Haven't you had enough?

694
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,540
Disgusting.

695
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:27,676
You're disgusting!

696
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:33,147
You--you see.

697
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:35,250
Please tell me
you can see it.

698
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:40,821
I can't get away from him.

699
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:43,959
He'll never stop hurting me.

700
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:46,927
Let me help you.

701
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:48,595
Don't! Don't.

702
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:49,897
Stay away.

703
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:54,536
Please.

704
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:46,954
Mary?

705
01:24:09,644 --> 01:24:10,779
I'm sorry.

706
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:40,275
Mary?!

707
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:45,345
No, wait!

708
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:43,304
You need to let go of her.

709
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:46,875
She's gone.

710
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:50,712
She's dead, James.

711
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:55,983
She's been dead for months now.

712
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:57,719
You know that.

713
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,945
You came.

714
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:26,314
Of course.

715
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:29,283
As soon as I could.

716
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:31,451
It's okay.

717
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:33,453
I never should have left.

718
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:36,190
Whether you would've
stayed or not,

719
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,792
I still would've gotten sick.

720
01:26:38,793 --> 01:26:41,094
Well, maybe
I could've helped.

721
01:26:41,095 --> 01:26:42,830
No one could've.

722
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:46,467
My father poisoned me.

723
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:50,205
He poisoned me my whole life.

724
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:56,277
I tried to shield you from it.

725
01:26:57,178 --> 01:26:58,880
I know.

726
01:27:00,682 --> 01:27:03,284
Can you help me lie down?

727
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:09,690
Sure.

728
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:29,744
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

729
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:54,801
Come on.

730
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:56,803
There you go.

731
01:27:56,804 --> 01:27:58,473
All right.

732
01:28:04,178 --> 01:28:06,347
Just tell me
how I can help you.

733
01:28:07,815 --> 01:28:09,416
You know.

734
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:15,290
He's lived inside of me
for so long.

735
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,959
I don't want him there anymore.

736
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,060
I can't do that.

737
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:21,596
I want to be free.

738
01:28:24,499 --> 01:28:26,467
Please, James.

739
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:29,003
Please.

740
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:34,808
Help me now.

741
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:12,499
That day, I should've
died with you.

742
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:33,221
You forgave me,

743
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:37,558
but I could never
forgive myself.

744
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,768
I was so selfish, Mare.

745
01:31:53,241 --> 01:31:55,176
Selfish and scared.

746
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:43,190
I'm ready now.

747
01:32:47,662 --> 01:32:49,564
No matter what it takes.

748
01:32:51,832 --> 01:32:53,968
No matter where it takes us.

749
01:32:59,674 --> 01:33:00,975
This time...

750
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:06,047
I won't let go.

751
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:23,563
Mr. Sunderland?

752
01:33:26,067 --> 01:33:28,235
Are you with us, Mr. Sunderland?

753
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:40,214
What?

754
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:44,184
Oh, come on.

755
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:48,355
You've got to be kidding me.

756
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:57,665
I'm so sorry.

757
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:00,567
Are you okay?

758
01:34:00,568 --> 01:34:02,069
Yeah.
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

759
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:10,077
Are you okay?

760
01:34:11,145 --> 01:34:12,380
I think so.

761
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:23,991
It's okay. I got it.

762
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:28,361
The latch is broken.

763
01:34:28,362 --> 01:34:29,362
How do you know that?

764
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:34,969
Shoot, that's my bus.

765
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:37,938
Hey, wait!

766
01:34:45,579 --> 01:34:47,747
Sorry, just...

767
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:53,787
Where were you heading?

768
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:55,422
The next city.

769
01:34:55,423 --> 01:34:58,692
Well, I just ruined your day.

770
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:02,262
Wouldn't be much of a gentleman
if I didn't try and help fix it.

771
01:35:02,263 --> 01:35:03,697
A gentleman?

772
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:05,765
Didn't know
they made those anymore.

773
01:35:05,766 --> 01:35:07,801
Gentleman named James.

774
01:35:07,802 --> 01:35:10,370
- I'm--
- Mary.

775
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:12,073
I saw it on your case.

776
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:29,189
You're a painter?

777
01:35:29,190 --> 01:35:30,391
Yeah.

778
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,237
