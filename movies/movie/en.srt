1
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,491
<i>In the beginning,</i>

2
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:37,119
<i>the universe was in perfect balance,</i>

3
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:41,457
<i>kept in peace and harmony
by four magic books.</i>

4
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,420
<i>The Alliance of Evil Wizards
made it their mission</i>

5
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:47,922
<i>to capture these books</i>

6
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,968
<i>and shroud the universe in darkness.</i>

7
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:57,139
<i>One of the books,</i>

8
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,392
<i>called Jaunty Grimoire, got away.</i>

9
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,561
That's me! Cha-cha-cha!

10
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,312
- Ze magic book!
- Where is it?

11
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,438
Find it at once!

12
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:09,151
<i>She was rescued by
a group of mighty blue guardians.</i>

13
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,987
Those evil wizards won't get you.

14
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,363
I've got her, Ron.

15
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,031
You're safe with us, little one.

16
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,951
<i>They swore to protect the magic book.</i>

17
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,996
<i>The fate of the universe depended on it.</i>

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,374
<i>So they hid her away in a secret location.</i>

19
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:27,670
Now shh! Don't tell anyone.

20
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,381
I'm in Smurf Village!

21
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:38,264
<i>La, la, la-la-la-la
Sing a happy song</i>

22
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:42,018
<i>La, la, la-la-la-la
Smurf the whole day long!</i>

23
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:46,105
<i>La, la, la-la-la-la
Sing a happy song</i>

24
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,232
Check this out.

25
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,502
<i>Everybody know
What we came to do</i>

26
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,838
<i>Everybody here
Want a chance with you</i>

27
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,340
<i>You know that's your cousin
And your brother</i>

28
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,924
<i>And the trees and the bees
And the birds</i>

29
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:14,967
<i>Want to dance with you</i>

30
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,219
<i>But I heard you were
Feeling blue</i>

31
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,180
<i>I don't know
If you're feeling cute</i>

32
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,307
<i>But you're looking
So put-together</i>

33
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,018
<i>I just started feeling cool</i>

34
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,603
<i>You gots to coordinate</i>

35
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,563
<i>I match with you--
Red, green and gray</i>

36
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,565
<i>I'm still here
We got mass appeal</i>

37
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,816
<i>Whatever color you feel Because</i>

38
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,777
<i>Everything goes with blue</i>

39
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,739
<i>It look good On me, good on you</i>

40
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,367
<i>Butter-fly in that suit</i>

41
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,285
<i>Everything goes with blue</i>

42
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,206
<i>I look in the sky, I see you</i>

43
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,041
<i>You're a star Bright and blue</i>

44
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,669
<i>Everything goes with blue!</i>

45
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,691
<i>You gots to coordinate</i>

46
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,984
<i>I match with you--
Red, green and gray</i>

47
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,736
<i>I'm still here
We got mass appeal</i>

48
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,363
Come on, No Name.

49
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,532
<i>Everything goes with blue</i>

50
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,242
<i>It looks, it looks</i>

51
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,746
<i>Good on me, good on you
Butter-fly in that suit</i>

52
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,665
<i>Everything goes with blue</i>

53
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,544
<i>I look in the sky I see you</i>

54
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,462
<i>You're a star Bright and blue</i>

55
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,673
<i>Everything goes with...</i>

56
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,764
Ha! Now that's what I call a banger!

57
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,099
Great job, Smurfs!

58
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,017
Yay for us!

59
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,602
A few timing issues,

60
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,521
but you almost had it this time, No Name.

61
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,857
Same time, same place tomorrow!

62
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,692
Adding it to the calendar, Papa Smurf.

63
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,235
Thank you, Calendar Smurf.

64
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,611
Isn't it grand

65
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:00,448
living in a place
where everyone has a thing!

66
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,365
Excuse me?

67
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,325
You stepped in it now, Papa.

68
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,369
Papa Smurf! Quick follow-up, if I may.

69
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,787
And here we go.

70
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,622
I still don't have a "thing."

71
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,040
And a quick follow-up to the follow-up:

72
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,126
Don't you think that that's a bit odd?

73
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,962
Like, Hefty Smurf is hefty.

74
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,964
I smash things.

75
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,134
And Worry Smurf worries.

76
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,511
You know, maybe everybody else
just doesn't worry enough.

77
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,597
And Brainy is...

78
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,848
really smart.

79
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,267
- And Grouchy is...
- Don't even say it.

80
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,560
And there's Camouflage Smurf.

81
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,603
I'm right here.

82
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,272
Out-of-Focus Smurf. Clumsy Smurf.

83
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,275
Way-Back-There Smurf.

84
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,443
I'm way over here.

85
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,153
Handlebar Moustache Smurf.

86
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,654
Quiet Smurf.

87
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,742
- What did he say?
- I have no idea.

88
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,660
But do you see what I'm saying, Papa?

89
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,954
Well, you're No Name. That's a thing.

90
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,915
Is it, though?

91
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,709
'Cause if my thing is
my distinct absence of a thing,

92
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,419
I'm actually...

93
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,296
nothing.

94
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,635
Hey, Sound Effect Smurf, can you back off?

95
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,266
Even he's got a thing.

96
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,935
And he's only been here since Tuesday.

97
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,521
I wouldn't worry
about it too much, No Name.

98
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,689
Some Smurfs just take a little more time

99
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,857
to find their thing.

100
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,067
It's in there.

101
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,402
You just got to find a way to let it out.

102
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,529
I've been thinking.

103
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,949
We don't have a Magic Smurf around here.

104
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,867
Maybe that could be my thing.

105
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,869
Smurfs can't do magic.

106
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,705
But I'm sure there's
something else for you.

107
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,207
Hey, List-Making Smurf.

108
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,875
What's left on our giant list of

109
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,378
Things-to-Try-to-Find-
No-Name-a-Name list?

110
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,339
Well, let's see, Papa.

111
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,174
Okay, to date we've tried...

112
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,762
10,248 things.

113
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,430
How many do we have left?

114
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,100
Two. Clog making and...

115
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,476
shark taming.

116
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:56,355
Well, that's wonderful news!
Let's try clog making.

117
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,357
That's a great idea, Papa Smurf.

118
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,400
Right, Smurfs?

119
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,609
Yeah!

120
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,076
I guess I could learn to like clogs.

121
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,960
Just take your time, No Name.
Don't rush it.

122
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,338
I'll just be right here. You got this.

123
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,883
If you could make something
with a square toe,

124
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:24,925
that'd be great. Thanks.

125
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,361
<i>- Aw.</i>
- Terrible clog!

126
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,078
You know, there's always shark taming.

127
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,789
That one's already taken.

128
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,751
That's too bad.

129
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,003
Hey, I have a great idea!

130
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,796
Let's go pick some Smurfberries.

131
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,007
It's hard to feel bad
with a sack full of Smurfberries.

132
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,176
I must admit, Smurfette,

133
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,553
there is a gnawing emptiness inside me

134
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,014
that all the Smurfberries
in the land couldn't fill.

135
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,350
It's hard to be the odd Smurf out.

136
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,685
I think I might know a little something
about that feeling.

137
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,603
What do you mean?

138
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,731
Well, I'm the only Smurf
created out of a block of clay

139
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,567
by our mortal enemy,
the evil wizard Gargamel,

140
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,195
in the hopes of luring
all Smurfs to their doom.

141
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,114
I mean, that was a lot for me to process.

142
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,492
So how do you handle that, Smurfette?

143
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:35,537
Well, I just think about all the friends
who love me and that I love back.

144
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,165
And I get the strength
to keep on keeping on.

145
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,126
You'll find your thing, No Name.
So don't give up.

146
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,671
Thanks, Smurfette. I cherish us.

147
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,632
I cherish us too... infinity!

148
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,385
I cherish you infinity times
infinity plus one.

149
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,720
It's not a competition.

150
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,807
But if it was, I'd cherish you

151
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,850
infinity times infinity

152
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,353
plus one times pi times infinity,

153
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,021
and I'd win.

154
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,407
Smurfette's right.

155
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,409
I need to stop dwelling
on what I don't have

156
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,452
and start dwelling on what I do.

157
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,458
But why is that so hard for me?

158
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,964
<i>Who am I?
Where do I belong?</i>

159
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,345
<i>Heavy heart, but I carry on</i>

160
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,224
<i>Searching for the answers</i>

161
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,812
<i>But I'm only Moving backwards</i>

162
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,064
<i>What they say</i>

163
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,775
<i>When they think of me</i>

164
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,531
<i>Does a name Tell you anything?</i>

165
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,909
<i>Does happy ever after</i>

166
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,539
<i>Ever really happen?</i>

167
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,710
<i>I'm always on the outside
Looking in</i>

168
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,962
<i>Never finding nothing</i>

169
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:11,717
<i>I'm always on the sidelines
In the end</i>

170
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,262
<i>And you only see The downside</i>

171
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,600
<i>When you're always
On the outside</i>

172
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:23,645
<i>I try to find
A reason to be strong</i>

173
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,148
<i>I'm holding on For something</i>

174
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:30,402
<i>But no one ever knows
What's going on</i>

175
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,615
<i>'Cause you keep it On the inside</i>

176
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,994
<i>When you're always
On the outside</i>

177
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,873
<i>Always on the outside</i>

178
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:49,463
<i>When you're always
On the outside looking in</i>

179
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,886
<i>Looking in</i>

180
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,480
<i>I need a chance
To prove them all wrong</i>

181
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,194
<i>And see the world
From the side I never walk on</i>

182
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,490
<i>I know there's
Something there for me</i>

183
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:22,955
<i>I still believe</i>

184
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,171
I wish I had my own thing.

185
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,554
Aw, poor thing.

186
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,057
It's in you. You just need a little help.

187
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,521
What's happening?

188
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:30,606
<i>Hallelujah! Hallelujah!</i>

189
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:32,608
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

190
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:39,531
<i>Hallelujah</i>

191
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,664
What the shell?

192
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,541
Sorry!

193
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,585
Quick question: What's going on?

194
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,838
Well, I wished for a thing and...

195
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,762
You got magic!

196
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,141
Smurfette!

197
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,521
Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!

198
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,441
You seem to have a bee in your bonnet.

199
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,943
What's on your mind, No Name?

200
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,279
It took 10,248 tries, but I did it.

201
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,365
I finally found my thing.

202
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,700
Well, that's fantastic! What is it?

203
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,827
I know you said Smurfs can't do magic.

204
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:26,912
But I can.

205
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,413
It's the thing I really wanted!

206
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,749
Wait, what are you talking about?

207
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,417
He never stopped trying to find his thing

208
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,710
and I'm so proud.

209
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:34,836
Show him!

210
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,381
Okay, let's see...

211
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,924
Va-va-voom!

212
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,936
That's what I'm talking about!

213
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,396
Stop!

214
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,323
Sire, it's Joel! It's Joel!

215
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,824
We found Smurf Village!

216
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,994
Smurf Village?

217
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,580
Wonderful, Joel! How did we do that?

218
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,832
There was an energy pulse detected
on our energy-pulse detector.

219
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,292
Shall I send in your brother?

220
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,502
Gargamel? Absolutely not.

221
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,172
That imbecile will only get in the way.

222
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,800
Just initiate extraction measures.

223
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,261
Yes, Lord Razamel. Most evil.

224
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:08,972
What is that?

225
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:09,890
He found us.

226
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,558
There's so much I didn't tell you.

227
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,644
<i>Your Smurf location hath been acquired!</i>

228
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,146
Everyone, listen to me!

229
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,023
Your lives are in terrible danger!

230
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,734
Smurf Village isn't safe anymore!

231
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,863
We have an emergency plan
in case this very thing happened.

232
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,114
Find Ken.

233
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,408
Finekin? What does that mean?

234
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,952
Find Ken!

235
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,748
Oh, no, Papa's gone!

236
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,586
Who will protect us now?

237
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,215
Why?

238
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,427
Wait, wait! Everybody calm down.

239
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,471
We need to be rational here.

240
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,641
There's only one evil wizard
who would do this.

241
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,142
Gargamel.

242
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,479
No Name, use your magic to find Gargamel.

243
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,982
That is not your greatest idea.
I just got Papa Smurfnapped!

244
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,610
Just focus. Concentrate.

245
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:09,116
Okay. Gargamel. Gargamel. Gargamel.

246
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,746
Success!

247
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,958
My sweet Azrael, what sound do you think

248
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,002
a Smurf makes right before he expires?

249
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,676
That's the sound I imagined, too.

250
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,595
You're such a delight, my furry angel.

251
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,431
<i>- Gargamel!</i>
- Yes?

252
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,766
Did you just speak human, Azrael?

253
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:35,851
<i>Show thyself!</i>

254
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,481
It's Smurf Village.

255
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:46,570
Oh, no, not the evil wizard Gargamel.

256
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,198
Look, Azrael, a poor abandoned Smurf.

257
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,077
Let's smoosh it.

258
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,704
Ha-ha. Sucker.

259
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,668
All right, Gargamel. Spill the beans.

260
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,297
- What did you do with Papa?
- Papa? Nothing!

261
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,340
Release me from this cage at once!

262
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,260
Something tells me you're
not telling us everything.

263
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,970
You got Papa snatched.

264
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,513
If I had Papa Smurf,

265
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,849
I'd be gloating about it right now.

266
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,603
Well, maybe we should give him
a makeover he'll never forget.

267
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,980
- Hey, Smurfs!
- Hey, Clumsy.

268
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,565
Guys!

269
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,608
Is this--

270
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,902
Is this any--

271
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,279
It's just--

272
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,033
Didn't Papa say to find Ken?

273
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,870
"Spin this track from beginning to end.

274
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,414
Through this portal you'll find Ken."

275
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,042
- Thank you, Clumsy.
- You're welcome.

276
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,878
No Name,
this is how we're gonna get Papa back.

277
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,463
Let's do it.

278
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,733
This is not going to end well.

279
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,072
I hate being eaten by a grammy-phone.

280
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,242
Run away!

281
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,629
What's happening?

282
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,549
We're obviously in some kind
of non-Newtonian portal.

283
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,050
Where is it taking us?

284
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,885
To the land of Ken.

285
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:21,266
Smurfette?

286
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,767
I'm here! Hefty?

287
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,019
Here! Worry?

288
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:24,936
Here. Brainy?

289
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,021
Present. Vanity?

290
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,314
Here! Grouchy?

291
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,066
Here. Unfortunately.

292
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,070
Where are all the mushrooms
and Smurfberries?

293
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,822
Where are we?

294
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,993
It's Paris.

295
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,578
How do you know that, Smurfette?

296
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,204
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i>

297
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,334
- Je ne sais what now?
- I'm not really sure.

298
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,670
Let's just stick to the plan.
Find Ken, save Papa.

299
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,339
Let's go, Smurfs.

300
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,673
And Turtle.

301
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,759
And Turtle. Sorry.

302
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,814
Hello, fellow wizard members

303
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,566
of the Evil Alliance.

304
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,531
We cannot hear you.

305
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,577
Oopsies. Sorry, I was just...
I was inquiring:

306
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,664
- Did you all have fun weekends?
- Cut the codswallop, Razamel!

307
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,666
We can't link our four books together,

308
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,542
erase all goodness and shroud the universe

309
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,211
in a cloud of Dark Magic forever

310
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,172
if we only have three books!

311
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,840
That's just Logic 101.

312
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,509
Yes, and I feel terrible about that,

313
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,428
and that's why I'm super excited

314
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,931
to share some great news with the council.

315
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,600
You have your magic book?

316
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,645
Well, no, not that great.
But I am so close.

317
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,648
He says that every time, you know?

318
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,858
It's been 106 years!

319
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,110
And Razamel,

320
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,570
how much longer
do we have to wait for you?

321
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,156
Do we need to replace you, Razamel?

322
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,159
- No! Please, no!
- Sire, a word?

323
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,620
Joel, I'm on a very important Zoom.

324
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:06,788
It's them, sire.

325
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,665
- Who them?
- The them.

326
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,543
Quick bathroom break, ladies and gents.

327
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,877
Thank you!

328
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,509
We're one step closer
to total evil dominance!

329
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,885
Huzzah for the bad guys!

330
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,096
Huzzah, I say!

331
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,681
Yes, sire. Huzzah, indeed.

332
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,778
Why did we design the Zoom room

333
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,489
so far away from my evil lair, Joel?

334
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,533
Well, that's where
your laptop is, my lord.

335
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,493
My podcast microphones are set up

336
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,620
in the Zoom room, Joel!

337
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:52,167
Why wouldn't I use my podcast
microphones for my Zooms?

338
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,595
Yes! Papa!

339
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,307
One hundred years in the making.

340
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,477
He hid, I seeked, and I won!

341
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,438
You've won nothing, Razamel.

342
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,733
Oh, really?
Who's in a jar in my evil lair?

343
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,779
- Where's the book?
- Shoot.

344
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,907
I don't know. I saw Papa,
and I grabbed him.

345
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,991
Maybe it's in his pocket?

346
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,452
Look at him, Joel.

347
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,497
He's... He's the size of
a slice of apple pie.

348
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,664
Would a book fit

349
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,833
into a miniature man's pockets, Joel?

350
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,461
Honestly, it would depend
on how big his pants were.

351
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,173
Go back from whence you grabbed him
and find that book! Now!

352
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,216
Yes, sire.

353
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,764
It's good to see you, Papa Smurf.

354
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,891
I cannot say the same.

355
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,559
I've got something!

356
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,603
In the same portal
that picked up Papa Smurf.

357
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,771
Seize it, Joel!

358
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,899
Bring that magic book back to me.

359
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:02,821
Yes... yes... yes!

360
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,286
What is this wretched place?

361
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,204
Gargamel?

362
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,790
Razamel, you found me!

363
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,043
I knew you wouldn't leave your own brother
stranded forever!

364
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,337
I missed you so much!

365
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:22,382
Yes, yes. Reunited, and it feels so good.

366
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,677
And you're the one who took Papa Smurf.

367
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,054
Well, all right, all right.

368
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,306
Well done, baby bro.

369
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:32,934
Too bad you didn't
get the rest of the Smurfs.

370
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,143
And you never will.

371
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,397
My Smurfs are hidden away,
safe and secure.

372
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,816
What did you do, Hefty?

373
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,359
I just asked 'em where Ken was!

374
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,486
I don't think they speak Smurf.

375
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:45,446
Don't bite my face!

376
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,450
Actually, a dog's bark
is worse than its bite.

377
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,005
This way!

378
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:10,388
Watch out!
It's a killer brush death machine!

379
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:32,452
I'm a bird! A beautiful bird.

380
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,228
- Who are these guys?
- City Smurfs.

381
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,566
Salut! My name's Moxie.

382
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:06,110
And we're the lnternational
Neighborhood Watch Smurfs.

383
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,781
Paris Division.

384
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,035
- That sounds important.
- It is.

385
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,204
What kind of Smurfs are you?

386
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,539
We are...

387
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,208
the standard kind.

388
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,752
Smurf Village Division.

389
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,631
Smurf Village? Where's Papa?

390
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,050
That's why we're here.
He told us to find Ken.

391
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,510
We'll take you to him.

392
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,475
We got you. Follow us. Hup, hup, hup.

393
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,275
Ken's inside the discotheque.

394
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,002
Get across the dance floor.

395
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,712
Avoid feet!

396
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,447
Come on!

397
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,847
- Almost there.
- Almost where?

398
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:58,890
There!

399
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,018
See you on the other side.

400
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,752
So, where's Ken?

401
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,212
I'm right here.

402
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,799
Let me guess. Papa Smurf's in trouble.

403
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,427
- How did you know that?
- I'm Papa Smurf's brother.

404
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:37,553
We had a plan

405
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,598
in case the worst thing
in the world ever happened.

406
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,975
And it looks like it just did.

407
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,812
Sorry about the mask.

408
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,314
I was just doing a quick exfoliation.

409
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,483
I never have time for self-care.

410
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,318
I always make time.

411
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,862
Is the book safe?

412
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,572
What are you talking about?

413
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,950
Papa never told you about the magic book?

414
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,159
Pardon me, Ken,

415
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:02,370
but we didn't even know
Papa Smurf had a brother.

416
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,080
Don't take this the wrong way,

417
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,958
but you Smurfs don't know
Smurf about Smurf.

418
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:10,878
With all due respect, Ken, we all Smurf.

419
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,089
In fact, I've probably personally Smurfed

420
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,465
more than you'll ever Smurf.

421
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,801
That sounds like a load of Smurf.

422
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,678
Can you Smurf that Smurf up?

423
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,304
I can Smurf that Smurf up

424
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,722
and have it delivered to your house.

425
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,225
Hey, come on, Smurfs. Stick a Smurf in it.

426
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,434
Smurf that.

427
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,520
- I don't like his Smurfitude.
- Ditto!

428
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,606
Ditto infinity
times infinity plus six. I win.

429
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:33,192
- Let's just leave it at that.
- Fine!

430
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:37,155
This is the handiwork
of the evil wizard Razamel.

431
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,614
He plays for keeps.

432
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,949
How do you know that?

433
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,577
The part that he plays
for keeps or the Razamel part?

434
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,870
Well... both?

435
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,997
I know a lot of things, fella.

436
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,541
- Cool. Cool.
- All right.

437
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,710
So let's go find this Razamel and...

438
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,128
And smash him!

439
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,297
I like this guy.

440
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,383
Let's get Papa Smurf back.

441
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,011
"Let's"? You're staying here.

442
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,888
I don't work with amateurs.

443
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,557
Well, joke's on you because
I like being called an amateur.

444
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,893
It means doing something
for the love of it.

445
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,686
And that's me. That's what I do.

446
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,146
Love.

447
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,192
That and a dime'll get you
a phone call in 1986.

448
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,151
What?

449
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,903
Exactly.

450
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,362
You don't get it.

451
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,409
Your enemies are everywhere.

452
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,204
And you have to be ready
to take 'em out like that!

453
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,169
That's one of the most
disturbing world views

454
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,337
I've ever encountered.

455
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,672
Funny coming from a bunch of Smurfs

456
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,883
who don't even know who they really are.

457
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,052
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means...

458
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,847
Smurfs are descendants
of mighty guardians.

459
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,892
We swore to protect the four magic books

460
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,353
from the Alliance of Evil Wizards.

461
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,439
But your Papa walked away.

462
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,567
Why would Papa keep that from us?

463
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,569
You'd have to ask him.

464
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,196
I will when we rescue him.

465
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,989
Oh, no, you're not coming with me.

466
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,033
We'd love to come with you!

467
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:07,203
No! I just said the 100% opposite of that.

468
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,372
Yay, we're going!

469
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,998
So, how do we do this?

470
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,416
Yeah, how do we do this?

471
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,378
Okay.

472
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,256
We do this by storming Razamel's castle,

473
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,966
and we take no prisoners!

474
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,426
Except for Papa.
We'll make sure and grab him.

475
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,304
- Hold down the fort, Moxie.
- Roger that, Captain Ken.

476
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,473
Did you bring the turntable?

477
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,309
The old-timey one?
No, we just went through it.

478
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:34,563
Come on, guys. The last one through
is supposed to bring the turntable!

479
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,565
How do we make a portal now?

480
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,317
We're not mind readers, ace.

481
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,443
And it doesn't matter,

482
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,904
'cause my friend can
get us there with his magic.

483
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,864
I never heard of a magic Smurf.

484
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:47,618
My magic confidence
is at a soft "four" right now.

485
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:51,289
Failure is the best teacher,
No Name. Dare to fail.

486
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,291
Failure would actually be bad.

487
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,835
Papa's counting on us.

488
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,212
Okay, Magic Smurf...

489
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:03,092
take us to Razamel's castle!

490
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:11,017
Give it another shot, No Name.

491
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,268
Okay.

492
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,105
Come on, come on.

493
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,816
Take us to Razamel's castle.

494
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,818
Please.

495
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,286
This is good!

496
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,748
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle
once removed.

497
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:38,085
You need some serious therapy and a hug.

498
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,805
Well, they're all going to die.

499
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,225
Look. He hates this.

500
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:56,479
This is so much fun!

501
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,189
Wow.

502
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,149
Can you believe it's been 62 years

503
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,652
since you sent me on my mission
to infiltrate Smurf Village?

504
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:04,904
Remember?

505
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,906
Yes. Yes, I do.

506
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,283
I just didn't think you'd ever do it.

507
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,827
You're hilarious!
Didn't you get my emails?

508
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,205
No. They must have gone to spam.

509
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,374
Spam? Why would they go to spam?

510
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,917
Fine! I blocked you.

511
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,252
You blocked me? Why?

512
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:22,588
We can discuss
all of this brotherly business

513
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,257
later during a sidebar. But for now...

514
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,385
Where is the magic book, Papa Smurf?

515
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,221
It's gone. I destroyed it.

516
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,598
You are the worst liar.

517
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,725
I know you didn't. You know why?

518
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,269
- Why?
- Because you're weak!

519
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,522
Like your best friend, Ron.

520
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,148
Don't you talk about Ron!

521
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,442
Look how upset he gets!

522
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,028
Don't worry, I'll get you to talk.

523
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,780
Those other blue rat monkeys

524
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,199
must have taken the magic book with them.

525
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,868
Where are your Smurfs now, Papa?

526
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,078
I'll never tell!

527
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,039
- I have something, sire!
- What is it?

528
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:59,291
The energy-pulse detector
picked up a fresh portal.

529
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,544
The Smurfs are trying to
infiltrate the castle.

530
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,879
Fortunately, our force field
knocked them off course.

531
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:07,425
And I know exactly
where it's sending them.

532
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,260
Joel? Let's go.

533
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,678
Wait, you're taking him?

534
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,888
Joel is my favorite hench-minion.

535
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:19,812
It worked!

536
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,440
It did if you were trying to kill us.

537
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,066
Brace for impact!

538
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,611
I think I just Smurfed my pants.

539
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,532
Hug the walls!

540
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:44,003
This doesn't feel like Razamel's castle.

541
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,921
That's because it's not.

542
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,631
This is bad.

543
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:48,924
Oh, no.

544
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,552
Turns out our magic Smurf here
is a bit of a dud.

545
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,472
Maybe you ought to just
stick to clog making.

546
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,850
We've been bounced to
the inter-portal way station

547
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,519
in the Australian Outback.

548
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:05,065
And now we have to deal
with the Snooterpoots.

549
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,650
Snooterpoots?

550
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,070
They're tricky creatures
who survive out here

551
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:13,449
by taking advantage
of lost inter-portal travelers.

552
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,910
They like cake.

553
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,496
Here, hold this cake inside
that rock until they bite.

554
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,581
Bite? Why do I have to do it?

555
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,833
- I don't want to lose an arm.
- Don't be a bully, Ken.

556
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:23,751
I'll do it.

557
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,419
No, no, I got us into this mess.

558
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,464
If anyone needs
to lose an arm, it'll be me.

559
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,648
Hold it out!

560
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:50,986
No Name!

561
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,177
Keep your hands and feet inside
the vehicle at all times.

562
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,304
- Vehicle?
- And watch your pockets.

563
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,015
Hey! My glasses! I need those!

564
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,395
Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake!

565
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,772
What's going on? I can't see anything.

566
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,900
Trust me, it's a good thing
you can't see what's coming.

567
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:47,042
Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake.

568
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:50,254
Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake.

569
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,181
Double double chocolate
with extra chocolate

570
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,933
from Fou de Patisserie, Paris.

571
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:04,893
That can only mean one thing.

572
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,895
Hello, Kenneth.

573
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
Mama Poot.

574
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,190
Am I that predictable?

575
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,944
Well, obviously not or I'd have
known you'd skip town on me.

576
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,572
Come on. We'll always have Paris.

577
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,698
Ooh la la.

578
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,996
Look, Mama, I can explain.

579
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,873
Save it for your bridge club, tough guy.

580
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:26,957
Words are cheap.

581
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,084
Actions are what matters.

582
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,253
Actions and... cake.

583
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:34,715
Well... looks like things worked out.

584
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,259
You're doing pretty all right
for yourself.

585
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,803
Yeah, Kenneth, business is booming.

586
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:43,307
Every yahoo thinks they can
navigate the multiverse these days, so...

587
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,226
Hey, that's permanent!

588
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,438
Looks like you yahoos could use a lift.

589
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,274
Yeah. We really could.

590
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,567
It's an emergency.

591
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,986
It always is.

592
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,364
- It's gonna cost ya.
- We brought cake.

593
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,406
Lots of cake.

594
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,201
You swindling scoundrels!

595
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,662
You don't get to talk
to my Poots like that,

596
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:05,663
you hear me?

597
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:08,123
Don't listen to him, my shaggy babies.

598
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:11,418
The emotionally unavailable Smurf
didn't mean it.

599
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,670
Okay?

600
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,339
Great. Now I'm all out of cake.

601
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,590
Stop it.

602
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:17,966
You know, I also take cash.

603
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,052
Or a watch.

604
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:23,597
But Mama Poot, this was a gift
from my grandpa.

605
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,973
Give her the watch, Ken.

606
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,642
Yeah, give her the watch, Ken.

607
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,726
Jeez.

608
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:29,812
Thank you.

609
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,774
All right, Snooterpoots, it's showtime!

610
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:41,824
Well, ticktock. Where to? Meter's running.

611
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,492
Razamel's castle.

612
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,785
Oh, no, no, no.

613
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,870
Heck no. No, sir.
Not interested. Deal's off.

614
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,330
What do you mean, the deal's off?

615
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:49,248
Here.

616
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,167
- This is just the wristband.
- Fine!

617
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,961
Okay, look, h-here's how this goes.

618
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,338
You never saw me,
we never talked, this never happened.

619
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:59,049
You can't back out now.
Papa Smurf is in trouble.

620
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,635
Guilt doesn't work on me, sister.

621
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,804
Please, Mama Poot, we have to save Papa.

622
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,930
Just drop us off.

623
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,391
No one will ever have to know
you were involved.

624
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,394
The Alliance of Evil Wizards
knows everything.

625
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,564
Nobody, and I mean nobody,

626
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,983
comes back from Razamel's castle alive.

627
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,569
The walls of the moat
are made of the bones

628
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,571
of the ones who tried.

629
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,325
Okay.

630
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,828
We've got a magic Smurf.

631
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,122
Maybe he can stop those wizards.

632
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:33,083
So you're telling me
your magic is strong enough

633
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,544
to take on the whole evil enchilada?

634
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:39,006
The whole evil enchilada--
What-what is that?

635
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,885
These wizards have one goal in mind:

636
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,262
To rule the world with evil

637
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:49,266
by getting rid of all
the goodness in the universe.

638
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:53,020
And nothing will stand in their way.

639
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,483
So tell me, Magic Smurf,
how you gonna handle that?

640
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,194
I will tell you how.

641
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,489
No Name, come back!

642
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,326
No Name!

643
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,288
No Name, stop!

644
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,708
I can't do it.

645
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,253
I can't take on the whole enchilada.

646
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,012
I don't have it in me, Smurfette.

647
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,182
I know I'm gonna let everyone down.

648
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,850
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

649
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,435
Pressure gets to all of us.

650
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,063
You just have to believe in yourself.

651
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:40,943
Yeah, but I don't even know
how I'm doing all this magic stuff.

652
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,528
This isn't me.

653
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:45,113
I can't face off
against a powerful wizard.

654
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:46,031
Listen.

655
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,284
That voice inside your head
telling you you're not good enough?

656
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,245
That voice is not who you are.

657
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,164
You're the only one
who notices that voice.

658
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,249
Whoa!

659
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,333
Yeah, "whoa."

660
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,419
You just need to decide
who you want to be,

661
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,130
and every day you'll
become yourself a little more.

662
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,465
And before you know it,

663
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,008
that voice will go away.

664
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,844
It worked for me.

665
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:12,933
<i>I know what's on your mind</i>

666
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,352
<i>I've been there, too</i>

667
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,564
<i>One too many times</i>

668
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:22,609
<i>It's time to let go</i>

669
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,570
<i>Go live your life</i>

670
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:28,156
<i>You've got a story</i>

671
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,742
<i>That you got to write</i>

672
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:34,288
<i>You were born to be great
Born to be real</i>

673
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,707
<i>Born to be wild</i>

674
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,127
<i>You were born to have faith
Faith in yourself</i>

675
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,130
<i>Born to survive</i>

676
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,467
<i>Don't ever let anyone</i>

677
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,137
<i>Say you're not anyone</i>

678
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,181
<i>When the world says Give it up</i>

679
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:56,059
<i>Keep going
'Cause you're onto something</i>

680
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,815
<i>Don't ever let anyone</i>

681
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,821
<i>Say you're not anyone</i>

682
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,744
<i>Say you're not anyone</i>

683
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,752
<i>So when you feel
Like nothing works</i>

684
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:25,339
<i>When you try
But it's getting worse</i>

685
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,882
<i>Getting harder By the minute</i>

686
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,425
<i>You don't have To be a cynic</i>

687
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,968
<i>You don't have To have a limit</i>

688
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,971
<i>The universe is telling us</i>

689
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,849
<i>There's something More to life</i>

690
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:41,146
<i>But you've been only seeing
What's in front of your eyes</i>

691
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,566
<i>You were born to be great
Born to be real</i>

692
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,735
<i>Born to be wild</i>

693
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,447
<i>You were born to have faith
Faith in yourself</i>

694
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,533
<i>Born to survive</i>

695
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:57,829
<i>Don't ever let anyone</i>

696
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:00,582
<i>Say you're not anyone</i>

697
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,377
<i>When the world says Give it up</i>

698
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,380
<i>Keep going
'Cause you're onto something</i>

699
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,760
<i>Don't ever let anyone</i>

700
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,933
<i>Say you're not anyone</i>

701
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,904
- You feeling better?
- Yeah.

702
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,490
The part with the kangaroos
was a little weird, though.

703
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,494
- What was that?
- I don't know.

704
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,540
No.

705
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,250
Snooterpoot Village!

706
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,334
Come on.

707
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,256
Mama Poot! What happened?

708
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,384
Razamel took two of my Snooterpoots
and the rest of you Smurfs.

709
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,594
He just took 'em!
He took 'em back to his castle.

710
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,721
Razamel was here?

711
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,055
Yes, he was.

712
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,807
And he just made the biggest mistake

713
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,309
of his miserable little life.

714
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,103
You still want a piece of him?

715
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:04,896
Oh, yeah.

716
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,606
We'll take the Scream Buggy.

717
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,108
And I'm driving!

718
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,027
The Scream What-y?

719
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,404
Why is it called the Scream Buggy?

720
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,240
Well, she runs on the fuel of your fear.

721
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,283
What? Why?

722
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,411
No idea.

723
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,008
Buckle up!

724
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,885
Hold onto your little Smurf nubs!

725
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,720
- I'm out.
- You can do this.

726
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,346
You! Brick me!

727
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,647
Yeah, yeah!

728
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,233
More fear! More fear!

729
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,577
More fear!

730
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:11,004
It's raining Smurfs! Hallelujah!

731
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,548
Oh, my sweet Smurfs. Come here.

732
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:14,633
Papa!

733
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,968
Let me look at you. Are you okay?

734
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,887
We were so worried about you.

735
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,555
Especially me.

736
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,517
I could never forgive myself
if any of you were harmed.

737
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,894
Joel, please hang my travel cape.

738
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,814
Joel, what do you call a group of Smurfs?

739
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:31,650
A gaggle? A herd? A troop?

740
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,068
A murder?

741
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,237
Let us out of here, Razamel!

742
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,739
Way to give it thirty percent, Papa Smurf.

743
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:39,074
Great stuff.

744
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,951
Now give me my book.

745
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,620
We told you we don't have it!

746
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,914
And where is my so-called brother?

747
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,292
He's relaxing with his feline associate
in the solarium, sire.

748
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,420
How I hate that cat!

749
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,506
Could we accidentally

750
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,092
help it shed its mortal coil,
Joel, my dear?

751
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,426
As you wish, lord sire.

752
00:43:58,511 --> 00:43:59,386
Joel!

753
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,221
Fetch me a Clamato. Room temp.

754
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,099
Hey, what about us?

755
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,852
Prisoners don't get clam drinks!

756
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:10,814
But I do have another treat
in store for you.

757
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,359
I hope you like... party games.

758
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,944
We're going to play one called:

759
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,237
Let's Squish A Smurf

760
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,613
Every Time Papa Doesn't Tell Me

761
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:20,448
Where The Last Magic Book ls...

762
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,993
Till All You Smurfs Are Squashed!

763
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,080
That doesn't sound like a fun game.

764
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:30,375
Joel, be a doll and move
these fetid degenerate goblins

765
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,586
to the Squishadrome for to squash.

766
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,593
I warned you about getting complacent.

767
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,971
Smurfs, can you give us a minute?

768
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:49,352
The book is still safe.
But why are my Smurfs here?

769
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:50,562
It's way too dangerous.

770
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,648
Well, maybe if you hadn't been
hiding away in Smurf Village

771
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,984
for the past 100 years
none of us would be in trouble.

772
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,528
You know I had my reasons for that.

773
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:01,239
Do you think Ron
would have just walked away?

774
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,367
Who's Ron?

775
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,831
Bringing her in hot!

776
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,424
That cleared out the sinuses.

777
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,344
Hey! You dead?

778
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,846
That was absolutely terrifying.

779
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,348
I think I swallowed my gum.

780
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:30,685
I'm coming for ya, Poots!
Mama's coming for her babies!

781
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,939
It might be good to not yell so much
and give away our location.

782
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,107
Right, right. Okay.

783
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,654
What is this place?

784
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:45,700
Munich, autobahn, Razamel's stupid castle.

785
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:52,207
He thinks it's so spooky.

786
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,292
So how do we get in there?

787
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,544
Well, it's an impenetrable fortress,

788
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:59,381
so we're gonna have to sneak in.

789
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,049
Okay, let's get some ideas going.

790
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,426
You know, blue-sky time, no judgments.

791
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:05,220
We pole-vault over the wall.

792
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,931
- That's a terrible idea!
- And that's a judgment.

793
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,809
Maybe we can exploit a weakness

794
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,769
no wizard can resist.

795
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,689
- What kind of weakness?
- A fried weakness.

796
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,818
- Your food is here.
<i>- Who ordered this?</i>

797
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:23,238
- Razamel Q. Wizard.
<i>- That sounds right.</i>

798
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,323
<i>He complains when his tunic gets too tight</i>

799
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,450
<i>but he's the one
who gets himself in this mess.</i>

800
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,378
So you can just order
any kind of food from anywhere?

801
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,754
Absolutely.

802
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,173
Just make sure you
tip the driver ahead of time

803
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,300
or they'll lick everything.

804
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,302
Okay, here's the plan.

805
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,429
We'll sneak into the castle
inside this bag

806
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,139
and when we get delivered to Razamel,

807
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,850
kablammo! We save everything.

808
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:55,395
We should have gotten more fries.
I'm a stress eater.

809
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,481
That's good.

810
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,529
It's the quill pen

811
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:07,741
that my great-great-great
grandfather Zazamel

812
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:12,037
used to sign the Treaty of the Alliance
of Intergalactic Wizards.

813
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,497
Razamel always worshipped this pen.

814
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,755
I'll just put it behind this.

815
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:23,506
Enjoying the solarium?

816
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,343
Yes! Very much. Thank you.

817
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:29,095
You're probably admiring Dadah's urn.

818
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,472
This is Dadah?

819
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,767
Oh, yes! Dadah in all his glory.

820
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,977
Sometimes, when no one's looking,

821
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:39,064
I sprinkle him into Joel's protein shakes.

822
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:42,692
You know, Dadah always
wanted us to rule together.

823
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:45,028
Remember how he said
that was going to happen?

824
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,946
And rule together we shall!

825
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,702
Once we get our hands
on that Jaunty Grimoire,

826
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:56,664
the whole universe
will be under the darkly magic control

827
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:59,584
of the Intergalactic Alliance of Wizards.

828
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,586
And finally,

829
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,673
all goodness shall be
eradicated for evermore.

830
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:07,634
Sounds amazing!

831
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,136
So you'll introduce me
to the Alliance, then?

832
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,389
Of course! Proudly!

833
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:16,476
But first, what do you schay
we schmoosh some Schmurfs?

834
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,813
I'd say that sounds like music to my ears!

835
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,524
And, hey, I just wanted to say

836
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,985
I'm so glad to be back
and that we're together again.

837
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,904
I love you, Razamel!

838
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,907
Best friend brother friend brother.

839
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,033
Love.

840
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,870
Well, ditto I'm sure.

841
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,916
Come along, Azrael.

842
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,002
We're going to watch
the Smurfs get squashed.

843
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,641
Absolutely repulsive.

844
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,855
We're inside the castle.

845
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,157
Maybe you should slow down on the fries.

846
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:14,492
You're right. Just one more.

847
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,036
- Are the plates ready?
- Yes, sir.

848
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:19,414
Hand!

849
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,499
- Ring!
- No ring, Mama.

850
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:23,251
Where's Terry the food taster?

851
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,337
- I don't know, on break?
- Fine, I'll taste it.

852
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:28,006
But if I die, I'll kill Terry!

853
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,926
Wait a minute. Did you forget
to order fries again?

854
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:33,761
You ate all the fries!

855
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,555
I love salty potato-based treats

856
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,140
and I will not apologize for that.

857
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,142
Hey, don't look at me.
I didn't make the order.

858
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,226
Just check again.

859
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:41,436
What do we do now?

860
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,438
I don't know. Can you magic some up?

861
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,731
Hand incoming!

862
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,985
O magic powers from
up on high, bring us fries.

863
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,445
Bring us fries!

864
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,238
Here they are.

865
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:55,033
Onion rings! Who ordered this garbage?

866
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,576
They're Razamel's favorite.

867
00:49:57,161 --> 00:50:00,038
- How did you know that?
- No idea. It just came to me.

868
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,582
This way.

869
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,112
Ready, Joel?

870
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:41,162
Good, it works. First Smurf, please.

871
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:43,915
Please, Razamel! Don't hurt my Smurfs.

872
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,501
Then tell me where the magic book is.

873
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,253
Somewhere you'll never find it!

874
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:51,047
Then let's loosen those lips!

875
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:53,508
Who shall we squash first?

876
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,301
Eenie...

877
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,095
meanie, miney--

878
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,012
I'll go.

879
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,229
Hear that?

880
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,856
That's the clicking sound of evil.

881
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,906
Let's go Smurf that wizard up.

882
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,624
Last chance, Papa!

883
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,462
We're here to save everything!

884
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,383
Deal with my awesomeness.

885
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:40,471
My, those are dated moves
for such a bold entrance.

886
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:43,099
State your business, stranger.

887
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,685
Free Papa Smurf at once!

888
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,895
And give me back my babies!

889
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,896
Or what?

890
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:51,149
Or I shall uncork all of my awesomeness

891
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,817
all over this place!

892
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,993
There must be a cat in here.
Is there a cat in here?

893
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,456
I knew it! Man, the dander gets me.

894
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,916
- Is that what I think it is?
- Uh-oh.

895
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:09,959
Could it be?

896
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,587
Jaunty Grimoire!

897
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,007
I knew you couldn't hide forever.

898
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,760
I thought you said
the magic book was safe!

899
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:22,263
How long have you been on my head?
And how did I not feel you there?

900
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:24,682
I have soft hands. And feet.

901
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,143
And I've only been up there
since you made a wish.

902
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,354
Cha-cha-cha!

903
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:30,396
I'm magic!

904
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:35,234
Wait. Were you doing the magic?

905
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:37,737
Yeah, kind of.

906
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,782
Yeah, but the moonwalking was all you.

907
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:44,494
Yeah, actually, that was me, too.

908
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,788
I didn't even do the moonwalk?

909
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,375
There's no such thing as a magic Smurf.

910
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:53,294
Chin up, pal. Don't quit on yourself.

911
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:55,254
You made a wish for a thing, so...

912
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:58,257
I just gave you a little head start.

913
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:01,052
You got a lot more magic in you
than you think.

914
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,971
You just got to let it out.

915
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,599
There's Papa! Hey, Papa!

916
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:10,353
Thank you for bringing
the final magic book right to me.

917
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,272
Look who it is!

918
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:16,359
It's our lost little
wizard girl family member.

919
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:19,237
I'm not part of your family, you freak.

920
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,238
Tut-tut.

921
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:23,658
Methinks these voluminous
Polaroid photo albums

922
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:27,328
from your childhood
would tell a different tale.

923
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,497
Here you are when you were clay.

924
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:33,126
Oh, here you are throwing horseshoes
at a Sunday barbecue.

925
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,795
And look at you laughing
at the caricaturist

926
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,214
who drew you in front of the Eiffel Tower.

927
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,549
That's me?

928
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:43,428
You may have looked different,
but you were always one of us.

929
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,139
Why don't I remember any of this?

930
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,559
And here you are enjoying
the wizard's favorite snack...

931
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:53,104
French fries. How you loved your fries!

932
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,064
That's a lie! I hate fries!

933
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,443
I knew I didn't like her for a reason.

934
00:53:58,527 --> 00:53:59,694
She's the darn enemy!

935
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,738
No, I'm a Smurf!

936
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:06,075
And P.S., newsflash, and FYl,
that's not who I am now.

937
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:09,662
You can never change what you really are.

938
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:13,541
Don't listen to him, Smurfette!
You're with us, now and always.

939
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,127
That's right! I'm with him. And them.

940
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,713
You sure about that?

941
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,382
You did exactly what
you were created to do.

942
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:24,218
You brought me Papa Smurf and Jaunty.

943
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:27,138
The final piece of the evil puzzle.

944
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,141
<i>Ergo ipso delicto... I win.</i>

945
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,351
Time to rule the universe.

946
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,520
I want to stay with Papa. Papa!

947
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:35,772
Jaunty Grimoire!

948
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,732
What a wonderful moment.

949
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,777
Too bad it has to be
interrupted by... reality!

950
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,529
- No!
- Chiballog badoo!

951
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:44,781
Bomba gee joo--

952
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,283
Wait a minute. What am I reading?

953
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,078
Yes, that's better.

954
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:55,792
May dark power course through
your pages now and forever!

955
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:58,294
I don't want to be evil!

956
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,846
I... am... Grimoire.

957
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,516
- No!
- Yes.

958
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,769
Well, thanks for saving me
a lot of squish time. See ya!

959
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,480
Wait. I'm not going with you?

960
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,190
To meet with the other wizards?

961
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,359
That's a big fat no!

962
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,071
This is the end of the road
for you, Gargamel.

963
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,532
But you said "Ditto"
when I said I loved you.

964
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:29,909
- I lied.
- I'm telling Mother!

965
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,454
Mother never respected you...
or your stupid cat.

966
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,875
Goodbye, Smurfs, and so long, brother...

967
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,585
forever!

968
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:53,015
I'm so sorry, everyone.

969
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,058
I'm sorry, too.

970
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,310
This is my first job
out of college, though.

971
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,062
I need a good review on my Linkedln.

972
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,939
Well, you're not getting one from me.

973
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,274
Fair enough.

974
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:05,152
That's pretty impressive engineering.

975
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:08,239
I can't believe I'm the one
who's gonna get smashed.

976
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,032
At least I'll be thin.

977
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,452
I'm gonna miss you guys.

978
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:14,996
I love you.

979
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,593
What? What are you doing?

980
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:30,136
It doesn't go down like this.

981
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,807
Yes, I may loathe the Smurfs
with the fury of a thousand burning suns

982
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:37,059
but I loathe my brother more

983
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:39,145
for disrespecting me

984
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,230
and my sweet, sweet Azrael.

985
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,984
And I've had enough of
said respectlessness.

986
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,528
Run, Smurfs! Run!

987
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,077
Prisoner escape! Prisoner escape!

988
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:05,254
Good idea, Azrael. Engage wing spell!

989
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:10,801
Look at me. I'm going to
need a bigger litter box.

990
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:13,429
Oh, my.

991
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,934
- Bring it!
- Come on, Ken!

992
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,352
I don't run from a fight.

993
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,978
We're not leaving you, brother.

994
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:26,943
All Smurfs and Snooterpoots spoken for.

995
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:30,154
Excelsior, my sweet Azrael!

996
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:40,164
I'm not feeling so majestic.

997
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,210
Assume crash positions!

998
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:50,883
<i>Happy Birthday--</i>

999
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,605
This is all my fault.

1000
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,067
This is all my fault.

1001
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:12,321
I can't believe I did
exactly what that wizard wanted me to do.

1002
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,241
I'm so sorry, No Name.

1003
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,411
No. This is my fault.

1004
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:23,082
The only reason any of this happened
is because I wanted to find my thing.

1005
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,252
If I hadn't been so selfish,
none of us would be here.

1006
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,088
No. It's not your fault, No Name.

1007
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,173
And it certainly isn't yours, Smurfette.

1008
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,135
This is all my fault.

1009
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:37,430
I kept secrets from you all.

1010
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,223
And that was wrong.

1011
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,102
I didn't want to lose any of you
the way we lost Ron.

1012
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,687
Who's Ron?

1013
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:48,357
He was the greatest Smurf who ever lived.

1014
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,611
I should have told you
about him a long time ago.

1015
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:54,363
<i>You're safe with us, little one.</i>

1016
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:57,408
<i>- I've got her, Ron.
- Those evil wizards won't get you.</i>

1017
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,785
Ron!

1018
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:03,956
<i>He was a Smurf of
tremendous courage and valor...</i>

1019
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,333
<i>and really, really great hair.</i>

1020
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:09,628
It's good to see you, my brothers.
It's been too long.

1021
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:12,673
We just had Smurfberry juice
and waffles together.

1022
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,884
Like I said, it's been too long.

1023
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,219
That magic book will be mine!

1024
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,809
Well, that was a bit of a letdown.

1025
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,482
Now that's more like it!

1026
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:33,986
<i>He dispatched baddies with a Smurfy blend
of elegance and lethality.</i>

1027
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:42,578
<i>I think it was safe to say
that Ron loved everyone and everything</i>

1028
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:46,207
<i>no matter how small
or insignificant they may seem.</i>

1029
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:55,049
I love you, brother. Or sister.

1030
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,551
<i>He was way ahead of his time.</i>

1031
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:02,389
<i>But Razamel soon got the upper hand.</i>

1032
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:10,940
That's really something else.

1033
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:12,942
I should probably start with
this one next time.

1034
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:30,793
Baby Jaunty!

1035
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,255
No!

1036
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:40,219
- Hang on! Papa's coming!
- I got you!

1037
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,762
Save the book!

1038
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:45,391
You're next!

1039
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,433
More vortex.

1040
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,981
Grab my hand, Ron!

1041
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:54,441
I probably should have cut my hair,

1042
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:55,985
like you guys suggested.

1043
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,028
You always were a free spirit.

1044
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:03,284
It was an honor and privilege
guardianeering with both of you.

1045
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,577
No!

1046
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,913
Fi-i-i-i-ist buu-u-u-u-mp!

1047
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,542
<i>Ron... was gone.</i>

1048
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,255
Now, I won't ask you again.

1049
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:19,049
- Give me that baby book.
- No.

1050
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:21,051
- No?
- Hey.

1051
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:22,761
No! Not in the face!

1052
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,065
That's why I created Smurf Village.

1053
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,067
So I could keep all of you safe.

1054
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:40,654
I couldn't lose any of you
like we lost Ron.

1055
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:43,490
There isn't a day goes by
that I don't think about him.

1056
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:45,159
I know, brother.

1057
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,413
It's time I told you
about our higher calling.

1058
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:54,126
We Smurfs are Guardianeers of Good.

1059
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,045
- What does that mean?
- It means...

1060
01:01:56,755 --> 01:02:01,258
that we have always been protectors
of peace and harmony in the universe.

1061
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:04,011
Even Smurfs who don't have a thing?

1062
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:05,512
Yes, No Name.

1063
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:08,098
But it's not just some thing
you call yourself.

1064
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:10,017
And it isn't who you are.

1065
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,186
It's who we are.

1066
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,396
It's the sum of all its parts.

1067
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:17,358
It's brains and brawn.

1068
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:21,237
It's a Smurf who always fights
for what she believes in.

1069
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:24,448
And even a Smurf who thought
he didn't have any thing

1070
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:27,993
but is willing to give everything.

1071
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,372
I'm not gonna sugarcoat this, Smurfs.

1072
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:35,459
The bad guys want to destroy
everything good in the world.

1073
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:36,961
And they can do it.

1074
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:38,629
But we're not gonna let them!

1075
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,882
Because there is nothing
we can't accomplish

1076
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:44,009
if we do it together!

1077
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:48,138
Now let's get that book
and save the universe!

1078
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:49,807
Let's do it for Ron!

1079
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,393
Let's get to Guardianeering!

1080
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:56,563
Wait! Where are we going?

1081
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:59,316
- Way to kill the mood, Glasses.
- He's right.

1082
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:02,945
Razamel and that book could
be anywhere in the universe.

1083
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,071
Attention!

1084
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,864
<i>Attenzione!</i>

1085
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:09,910
I know exactly where
the wizards have taken all four books.

1086
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,787
Now, I will share this information

1087
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,957
with you vicious garden weasels
on one condition.

1088
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,084
- Name it.
- That I be in the room

1089
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,669
to see the stupid, angry look

1090
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,839
on my stupid, angry brother's
mean, stupid, angry face

1091
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:25,342
when he sees you all alive and thriving.

1092
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:26,427
It's a spite mission.

1093
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,137
I think we got it.

1094
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,847
We all get what we want.

1095
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,349
But after that,

1096
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:35,019
our little alliance is over.

1097
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:38,147
Yeah, okay, deal. Where to, freaky-deaky?

1098
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,481
To the ninth dimension,

1099
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:41,567
the nexus of space and time

1100
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,944
that represents
all possible worlds and all--

1101
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:46,488
- Just get in the car!
- Yes. Sorry. Of course.

1102
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:49,241
Yeah!

1103
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:07,801
Hello, everyone! I have big news.

1104
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:10,137
And it involves me and my magic book.

1105
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,724
What a surprise. Raz-a-mope is late.

1106
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,601
What could you have been doing?

1107
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,187
Having your hair cut by a blind raccoon?

1108
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:22,649
Do you know what?

1109
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:26,278
I'm sick of being treated
like garbage by all of you,

1110
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:29,490
with your sarcastic comments
and mock merriment.

1111
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,700
Late and lame.

1112
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:32,868
You're all lame!

1113
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,707
You'll make wonderful hench-minions

1114
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,751
now that I'm the lord of the universe.

1115
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,754
Solo! Me. I. Moi!

1116
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:48,133
Well, time to start chanting.

1117
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,053
Yeah-- no chance I'll hit that note.

1118
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,846
And here we go!

1119
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,725
Ommm beklartz...

1120
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,310
flunknard!

1121
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:06,110
You have got to be kidding me.

1122
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:09,029
The Guardianeers of Good are here.

1123
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:11,156
We'll try not to hurt you,

1124
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,825
but we're not making any promises.

1125
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,119
It's not bragging.
That's just me being real.

1126
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,329
This is bad.

1127
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,206
He's linked all the books.

1128
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,874
Ken, we need a plan.

1129
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:24,211
We're Guardianeers, Papa. We are the plan.

1130
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:25,712
- Charge!
- Charge!

1131
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:26,922
Hold on!

1132
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,676
Well, that's adorable.

1133
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,885
Kachow!

1134
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,307
Your goodness is mine!

1135
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:40,144
Into the vortex, Smurf spirits.

1136
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:43,897
Razamel stole their Smurfy goodness.

1137
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:45,274
We can get them back

1138
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,569
if we break the spell by rescuing Jaunty.

1139
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,488
Where are you going, traitor?

1140
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:52,656
Traitor?

1141
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,576
Well, I brought the Smurfs to you!

1142
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,578
This was a spite mission.

1143
01:05:58,830 --> 01:05:59,830
It was.

1144
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:02,124
- In the water bottle you go.
- No!

1145
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:04,585
He's distracted.

1146
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:07,838
You thought I forgot about you?

1147
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:12,384
Whose goodness shall I take first?

1148
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,219
No!

1149
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:17,514
Papa!

1150
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:20,767
Don't give up, my precious Smurfs.

1151
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,187
You're Guardianeers.

1152
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,522
It's up to you now.

1153
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:35,407
Smurfette?

1154
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,826
My work is done.

1155
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,662
I finally delivered everything you wanted,

1156
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:42,664
Your Evil Lordship.

1157
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:43,832
What is this?

1158
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:46,126
I have always been on your side.

1159
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:47,336
What? No!

1160
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,338
Well, well, well.

1161
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,048
That's what we in the evil business

1162
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,467
call the long con.

1163
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:57,054
Welcome home, sinister Smurf demon.

1164
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:57,971
Thank you.

1165
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:01,934
Psych!

1166
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:03,894
Got you, Jaunty!

1167
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,729
Thank you, Smurf--

1168
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:20,035
Stop! That's the interdimensional abyss.

1169
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:24,331
Anyone who goes in there never
ever comes back the same.

1170
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,085
You've got nowhere to go.

1171
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,012
What do we do now, Jaunty?

1172
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:40,764
Warning! Lose the heels.

1173
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:43,058
You're really not gonna like
this first dimension, Smurfette.

1174
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:44,101
Why?

1175
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:47,771
Clay?

1176
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,316
That's why I feel
overly thick and bloated.

1177
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,526
Where's the book?

1178
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,695
Give that back to me!

1179
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,032
That's what happens to handsy fellas.

1180
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:01,243
- Find a door!
- Go, Smurfette!

1181
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,383
This is the worst dimension!

1182
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:17,884
Stay away from erasers!

1183
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:19,511
- What's that?
- What?

1184
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,346
- Made you look.
- Come on.

1185
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:23,849
Help! Help! A mean old wizard got me!

1186
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:26,977
Eraser!

1187
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:30,272
That's my book, you freakish popinjays!

1188
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:35,569
Oh, no! I can only run from left to right!

1189
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,280
Here! Jump up these tiny hills.

1190
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:42,784
This dimension isn't so hard, actually.

1191
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:44,828
Hand over the eight-bit book, Smurfs,

1192
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:48,248
or face the wrath of my evil picket fence!

1193
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:50,751
It'll take more than a fence to stop us.

1194
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,424
You!

1195
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,218
Now you shall taste the Might!

1196
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:02,220
With Smurf filled anguish!

1197
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:14,316
Ugh! This is my least favorite dimension.

1198
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:17,653
What are you?

1199
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:19,029
I'm a tardigrade,

1200
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:22,324
the most rugged micro animal
in the universe.

1201
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:25,118
Our motto is "Live tiny, die never."

1202
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,704
Hi, Tardi, nice to meet you, bye!

1203
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:30,165
Nice to meet you, too! Bye!

1204
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,627
I just want a friend.

1205
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:36,088
Will you stay here with me forever?

1206
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,881
Absotively not!

1207
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:41,468
Is this...

1208
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,428
Smurf Village.

1209
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,723
We're home.

1210
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:48,392
Cha-cha-cha!

1211
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:51,186
All you have to do
is get me to Papa Smurf's mushroom house

1212
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:54,439
and I can hide away for
another hundred years, easy!

1213
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,074
Welcome back.

1214
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,367
Papa.

1215
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,202
You're okay.

1216
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:09,037
I've never been better.

1217
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,124
It's good to have you home.

1218
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,209
We did it, Papa.

1219
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:15,794
Keep her safe.

1220
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:19,923
I knew you'd come through...

1221
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,508
Smurfette.

1222
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:23,969
I don't understand.

1223
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,846
Let me explain.

1224
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,140
We're in the surreal dimension.

1225
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:31,351
It's made of your dreams and nightmares.

1226
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:32,769
No.

1227
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:34,354
Thank you for your service.

1228
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:38,275
Time to rid the universe
of all things good.

1229
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,527
Bye-bye, puppies.

1230
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:43,321
Ciao, daisies.

1231
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:44,489
He's done it.

1232
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:47,409
He's sucking all of the goodness
out of the universe.

1233
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:51,371
What the shell?

1234
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,832
Release Jaunty!

1235
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,418
We're not gonna let this happen, Razamel.

1236
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:59,045
And just who is going to stop me?

1237
01:10:59,130 --> 01:11:00,172
You?

1238
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:02,466
You are nothing!

1239
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,592
I'm not nothing.

1240
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,762
Then who are you?

1241
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:09,931
I'm... I'm...

1242
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:11,892
That's what I thought.

1243
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:15,145
You're nobody.

1244
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,062
No Name!

1245
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:17,773
No Name!

1246
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:19,524
Can you hear me?

1247
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,114
Who are you, No Name?

1248
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:28,617
Who are you?

1249
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,243
Yeah, who?

1250
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:33,580
I... I-I don't know.

1251
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:35,999
You should've just stuck to clog making.

1252
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:38,835
Stay with me, No Name.

1253
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:40,378
Please.

1254
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,550
You got more magic in you than you think.

1255
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,970
That voice inside your head
telling you you're not good enough?

1256
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:51,264
That voice is not who you are.

1257
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:57,229
I don't know who I am, Papa.

1258
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:58,855
And I don't think I ever will.

1259
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,565
I know who you are.

1260
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,195
You're kind and fair.

1261
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,823
You're strong because you're determined.

1262
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:10,075
You remind me a lot of Ron in that way.

1263
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,077
Really? How?

1264
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,495
He was resilient.

1265
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,038
When Ron got knocked down,

1266
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:17,249
he'd get right back up on his feet.

1267
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,125
Just like you.

1268
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:23,171
But Ron knew who he was. He had a thing.

1269
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:25,841
Not at first.

1270
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:29,553
Some Smurfs just take a little
more time to find their thing.

1271
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:32,556
And, No Name... it's your time.

1272
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:45,527
<i>La... la... la-la-la-la...</i>

1273
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,279
What? What are you saying?

1274
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:51,825
<i>La, la, la-la-la-la...</i>

1275
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:54,202
I know who I am.

1276
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:58,373
Hey! We're not done!

1277
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,709
I've had just about enough of you!

1278
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:04,588
No Name!

1279
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,548
But-But how?

1280
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:08,425
Who are you?

1281
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:10,302
Call me

1282
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:14,764
I'm-The-Smurf-Who's-Gonna-
Kick-Your-Big-Giant-Butt Smurf!

1283
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:21,563
The Smurf-Who's-Gonna-Kick-
Your-Big-Giant-Butt Smurf?

1284
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:24,107
I don't know, I think it's got
a bit of pizzazz.

1285
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:25,400
You don't like it, do you?

1286
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,278
I don't care what you call yourself!

1287
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:32,490
One lone Smurf can't take on
the whole evil enchilada!

1288
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:35,035
That's the difference
between you and me, Razamel.

1289
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:36,453
I'm not alone.

1290
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:39,831
<i>La, la, la-la-la-la
La, la, la-la-la</i>

1291
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:41,833
Smurfette...

1292
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:46,212
<i>La, la, la-la-la-la
La, la, la-la-la</i>

1293
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:52,093
<i>La, la, la-la-la-la
Sing a happy song</i>

1294
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,262
<i>La, la, la-la-la-la...</i>

1295
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:57,098
Why are you singing that dreadful song?

1296
01:13:57,183 --> 01:13:59,559
Because we are the Guardianeers of Good.

1297
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:01,811
And I believe you have something of ours.

1298
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:07,317
Wow.

1299
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:40,100
No!

1300
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:51,945
No, stop it! Stop this right now!

1301
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,500
Amazing.

1302
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:08,920
What?

1303
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:15,760
No!

1304
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:24,894
Wait.

1305
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:26,438
What are you doing?

1306
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,401
Smurfette, I command you
to help me at once!

1307
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:34,195
You're an evil wizard and always will be!

1308
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,782
Not true. Who I am is up to me.

1309
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,576
I decide.

1310
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,245
I am a Smurf.

1311
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:45,540
We may be small, we may be adorable,

1312
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:48,209
but don't mistake
our kindness for weakness.

1313
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:51,337
Because kindness always wins.

1314
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:54,090
Unite in Smurfitude!

1315
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,068
No! My books!

1316
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:14,861
They're not evil anymore!

1317
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:18,782
Cha-cha-cha!

1318
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:22,660
That's good.

1319
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:28,333
Hey, everybody.

1320
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:32,212
I hate you.

1321
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:33,296
I know.

1322
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,133
Thank you, No Name.

1323
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:39,761
I mean... what did you
call yourself again?

1324
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,972
I'm-The-Smurf-Who's-Gonna-Kick-
Your-Big-Giant-Butt Smurf.

1325
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,267
You're right. Terrible.

1326
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:47,519
I can beat that.

1327
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:48,436
Wait!

1328
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:50,897
What about Kick ♪♪♪♪ Smurf?

1329
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:55,485
Kick ♪♪♪♪ Smurf is definitely
inappropriate.

1330
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:57,946
You're lucky Sound Effect Smurf is here.

1331
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:00,865
Sorry. I don't know what the ♪♪♪♪
I was thinking.

1332
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:02,283
Hey! I said "Smurf."

1333
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,872
You know, maybe
I'll stick with Magic Smurf.

1334
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:09,624
It-It's got a nicer ring to it.

1335
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,209
It's classic.

1336
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:14,504
Kid... you earned your name.

1337
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:17,173
Give it up for Magic Smurf!

1338
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:20,969
- Magic Smurf!
- That makes so much sense.

1339
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:23,888
How did this happen?

1340
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:27,058
You came up against
the Guardianeers of Good.

1341
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:30,061
This is for Ron.

1342
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:33,982
- You missed me, idiot.
- Did I?

1343
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,403
No! No!

1344
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,571
Help me, dear brother!

1345
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,114
I... I...

1346
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:42,740
love you.

1347
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:45,952
Funny how you're finally
able to say it now.

1348
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:47,412
How about Azrael?

1349
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:50,915
How do you feel about
my precious feline associate?

1350
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,834
He has feelings, you know.

1351
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:57,046
I love you, Azrael.

1352
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:01,593
In the immortal words of
Azrael's favorite pop crooner

1353
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,596
and social provocateur, Jonathan Mathis,

1354
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,265
"too much, too little, too late."

1355
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:08,933
No! No!

1356
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:12,020
You will all pay!

1357
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:15,940
Well, that was quite
the successful spite mission.

1358
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:17,150
I'm off.

1359
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,695
It's Razamel!

1360
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:25,491
Did somebody say... Ron?

1361
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:28,369
It's Ron!

1362
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:35,001
Judging by the smile
on everyone's face, looks like

1363
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:37,795
the Guardianeers of Good
took care of business.

1364
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,757
These Smurfs were more
than up to the task.

1365
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,176
And they did it their own way.

1366
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:48,640
Ron! I thought you were a goner!

1367
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,476
Well, if by goner, you mean I was stuck

1368
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,560
in the tenth dimension

1369
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:54,646
guarded by every variation
of vicious dragon

1370
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,606
in every possible variation
of the universe

1371
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:59,609
then you'd be right. I was a goner.

1372
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:03,071
So, what did I miss in the last 106 years?

1373
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,989
Well, that depends.

1374
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:07,367
Are you thinking about time
in a linear fashion

1375
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,410
or as a series of flat circles?

1376
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,120
What?

1377
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:12,705
Exactly.

1378
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:16,334
What do you say we get out of here
and head back home,

1379
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:19,712
where life is good and things
don't crunch our brain so much.

1380
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:21,673
That sounds pretty Smurfy to me.

1381
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:49,617
My dear Smurfs,

1382
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,412
we will no longer hide away
from the world.

1383
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:54,747
Whenever we're called to action,

1384
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,249
we'll be there.

1385
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:59,085
Because we're stronger together!

1386
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:02,059
Best friends forever and ever...

1387
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:03,436
Help me!

1388
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,980
Joel! Joel!

1389
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:16,073
Break time's over, Joel.

1390
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:19,243
We have unfinished business
with those Smurfs.

1391
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:31,031
