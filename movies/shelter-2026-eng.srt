1
00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:33,185
Okay. Mind your fingers.

2
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:39,917
Just like before, now.

3
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,485
What you looking at?

4
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:33,024
What are we gonna do today?

5
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:37,160
Make yourself useful,
and give it some thought.

6
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,898
Checkmate.

7
00:07:27,373 --> 00:07:28,177
Okay.

8
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:52,237
Leave the crate
and come straight back.

9
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,537
The weather looks like
it's picking up.

10
00:08:47,753 --> 00:08:49,385
Don't come up here again.

11
00:08:57,765 --> 00:08:59,835
Most people just say thank you.

12
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:06,644
It's very important
that you listen.

13
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:09,640
Don't ever come up here again.

14
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,580
You know,
me and my uncle come up here

15
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:13,847
week after week,
bringing you supplies,

16
00:09:13,882 --> 00:09:16,346
and yet you never even come down
to greet us.

17
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:18,920
Why is that?

18
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:33,169
I'm not afraid of you!

19
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:05,661
<i>Message to all vessels.</i>

20
00:10:05,696 --> 00:10:09,204
<i>Gale force winds are in
serious effect across the coast.</i>

21
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:17,206
Jessie, come on!

22
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:23,879
<i>New storm formed now heading
towards the Hebrides.</i>

23
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,458
Don't give me that look.

24
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,435
Jessie!

25
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,071
Come on!

26
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:50,308
Papa!

27
00:10:51,645 --> 00:10:53,014
Come on!

28
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:00,551
Urgh!

29
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:05,587
Jessie!

30
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,490
Uh... argh!

31
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:27,162
Where's my uncle?

32
00:14:31,194 --> 00:14:32,964
Where's my uncle?!

33
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,638
He's dead.

34
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,745
The trawler went down.

35
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:52,253
He was trapped.

36
00:15:52,615 --> 00:15:54,117
Agh!

37
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:09,825
Agh!

38
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,501
We need to get
the swelling down.

39
00:16:42,893 --> 00:16:45,366
Why haven't you called anyone
about what happened?

40
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,962
Not even the police?

41
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:52,637
Who else knows we're here?

42
00:16:54,907 --> 00:16:56,014
No one?

43
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:58,346
Just rest.

44
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:33,816
You have to take me back.
You can't just keep me here.

45
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:37,954
I... I mean, I... I don't even
understand why you're here.

46
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:39,514
My uncle told me
that this lighthouse

47
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:41,087
hasn't been working in years.

48
00:17:41,122 --> 00:17:43,754
Yet you never leave here. Why?

49
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,432
My family will be
looking for me.

50
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,206
You don't have a family.

51
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:01,607
Your mother died
a few years back.

52
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:04,775
Never knew your father.

53
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,615
Your uncle's taken care of you
ever since.

54
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:11,045
Because there was no one else.

55
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:14,752
How do you know that?

56
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:18,054
Well, someone will come looking.

57
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:21,528
Will they?

58
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:25,895
There's nothing here for anyone.

59
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:11,863
It's just a dream.

60
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:16,065
It's just a dream.

61
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:24,139
I know you're scared.

62
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,318
And in a lot of pain.

63
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,556
When you use a weapon,

64
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:38,923
you never operate from fear.

65
00:21:42,264 --> 00:21:45,032
Always balance your emotions.

66
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:46,337
Keep your wits.

67
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:49,934
Hold it like this.

68
00:21:52,242 --> 00:21:54,741
Your thumb up against the hilt.

69
00:21:55,473 --> 00:21:57,007
Tight in the palm.

70
00:21:58,112 --> 00:21:59,240
Hold it up.

71
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,184
Good.

72
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:05,587
That's a strong grip.

73
00:22:06,823 --> 00:22:07,919
Good.

74
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,626
I'm gonna look at your ankle.

75
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:02,908
Come on.

76
00:24:34,568 --> 00:24:37,072
How did you know my uncle?

77
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,575
We served together.

78
00:24:39,374 --> 00:24:40,907
In the Royal Marines.

79
00:24:43,544 --> 00:24:45,274
He never told me your name.

80
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:48,178
What is it?

81
00:24:49,652 --> 00:24:51,918
Would it make a difference
if you knew it?

82
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:55,185
Well, I'd at least know
what to call you.

83
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,927
We're doing okay so far.

84
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,460
Well, at least tell me
your dog's name, then.

85
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:10,640
He doesn't have one.

86
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:12,370
What?

87
00:25:12,406 --> 00:25:14,806
That's crazy.

88
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:16,470
Your dog doesn't even
have a name?

89
00:25:19,675 --> 00:25:20,809
Well...

90
00:25:20,844 --> 00:25:22,883
I'm going to call him...

91
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:26,048
Jack.

92
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,658
Right, Jack? Come. Hey.

93
00:25:31,027 --> 00:25:32,293
Jack.

94
00:25:32,328 --> 00:25:34,059
He likes the name Jack.

95
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:36,897
Jack.

96
00:25:44,373 --> 00:25:48,040
Black Queen... to F2.

97
00:25:49,947 --> 00:25:51,111
Check.

98
00:25:54,783 --> 00:25:57,250
You didn't tell me you could
play chess.

99
00:25:57,286 --> 00:25:58,380
You never asked.

100
00:26:01,054 --> 00:26:03,455
Looks like I've got myself
a worthy opponent.

101
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,841
It's infected.

102
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:23,944
- Can't we just go to a hospital?
- No.

103
00:26:26,214 --> 00:26:27,079
No.

104
00:26:31,387 --> 00:26:33,382
I'll get what's needed.

105
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:56,600
<i>Ten years ago,
the Prime Minister</i>

106
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:58,659
<i>assured this committee
and the nation</i>

107
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:01,062
that her government, I quote...

108
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:03,966
"Was not and would not ever
collect data

109
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:05,974
on British citizens."

110
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:09,877
And yet, thanks to the recent
hack into MI6's servers,

111
00:29:09,912 --> 00:29:12,277
we have now learned that not
only has MI6

112
00:29:12,313 --> 00:29:15,849
been systematically harvesting
the personal information,

113
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:18,486
calls, emails,
and voting patterns

114
00:29:18,522 --> 00:29:20,154
of the British population,

115
00:29:20,189 --> 00:29:24,655
but has been doing so in order
to create an intelligence...

116
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:26,360
super-system.

117
00:29:26,662 --> 00:29:28,522
An advanced surveillance network

118
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:32,127
called Total Human
Engagement Analytics,

119
00:29:32,162 --> 00:29:34,695
or more affectionately, THEA.

120
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,831
Some of the details are,
of course, classified.

121
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:40,676
The essence of THEA is to make
better-informed decisions,

122
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,436
to anticipate threats
more effectively.

123
00:29:43,939 --> 00:29:47,748
<i>What you've been doing
is unlawfully invading the life</i>

124
00:29:47,784 --> 00:29:49,843
<i>of every person in this country.</i>

125
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:52,487
<i>If they're innocent,
they have nothing to hide.</i>

126
00:29:52,522 --> 00:29:54,056
Since THEA went online,

127
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:58,991
MI6 have intercepted threats
at a rate never before imagined.

128
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:01,161
Perhaps you could simply say
thank you.

129
00:30:02,766 --> 00:30:05,929
Let me be clear
on how this ends.

130
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:09,767
With you and Prime Minister
Fordham under investigation,

131
00:30:09,803 --> 00:30:12,075
and THEA dismantled.

132
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,846
Haneron was grandstanding,
Prime Minister.

133
00:30:16,913 --> 00:30:18,747
We both know the whole
thing's a circus,

134
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:20,915
just without
the entertainment value.

135
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:23,846
Haneron is gaining traction
in this election.

136
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:25,680
And this leak...

137
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:28,486
it's a national embarrassment.

138
00:30:29,155 --> 00:30:31,191
We're gonna have to steady
the ship.

139
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,756
You need a sacrificial lamb.

140
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:37,865
Let's face it, Stephen.

141
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,568
You're probably
the best spymaster

142
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:40,967
this country has ever produced.

143
00:30:41,002 --> 00:30:44,638
But you are
a hopeless bureaucrat.

144
00:30:45,107 --> 00:30:47,944
We all have our shortcomings,
Prime Minister.

145
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:56,046
The tape's stopped.

146
00:30:56,081 --> 00:30:58,144
It's just the two of us now.

147
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,290
I think this could be
a blessing.

148
00:31:02,325 --> 00:31:03,492
Really?

149
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:06,897
To get you back into the shadows
where you belong.

150
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:10,461
Could be our little secret.

151
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,035
Indeed, ma'am.

152
00:31:14,364 --> 00:31:16,462
Roberta Frost, your number two,

153
00:31:16,498 --> 00:31:18,771
she'll take over as head of MI6

154
00:31:18,807 --> 00:31:20,301
as an interim appointment,

155
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,744
and then after the election,

156
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,080
I'll appoint somebody
more appropriate.

157
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,147
Roberta's a good choice.

158
00:31:26,183 --> 00:31:30,186
She's a good team player.
And we don't want any outsiders.

159
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,713
Exactly.

160
00:31:32,655 --> 00:31:34,485
Enjoy your retirement.

161
00:31:34,988 --> 00:31:36,652
Thank you, Prime Minister.

162
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,730
How old is she?

163
00:31:50,671 --> 00:31:52,008
About there.

164
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:57,375
Like I said we were supposed
to go in the first place,

165
00:31:57,411 --> 00:31:58,943
but I thought we were gonna
go bowling instead.

166
00:31:58,979 --> 00:31:59,976
That's a bit more fun, no?

167
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:00,908
We always go...

168
00:32:10,018 --> 00:32:12,490
<i>like I said we were supposed
to go in the first place,</i>

169
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:13,794
<i>but I thought we were gonna
go bowling instead.</i>

170
00:32:13,829 --> 00:32:15,122
<i>That's a bit more fun, no?</i>

171
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:29,474
High priority THEA alert.

172
00:32:30,174 --> 00:32:31,773
We have a retinal match.

173
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:34,841
Timur Tchermoev.

174
00:32:34,876 --> 00:32:36,915
He's a high-value target,
wanted for the bombing

175
00:32:36,951 --> 00:32:39,550
of our embassy in Algeria.

176
00:32:41,024 --> 00:32:43,193
His file is filled
with similar atrocities.

177
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,321
Location?

178
00:32:44,356 --> 00:32:46,493
Stornoway. Outer Hebrides,
Scotland.

179
00:32:46,895 --> 00:32:48,966
Repositioning satellites now.

180
00:32:49,965 --> 00:32:51,628
Who's our nearest assault team?

181
00:32:53,128 --> 00:32:54,699
Alpha.

182
00:32:54,735 --> 00:32:56,072
Send them.

183
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:01,407
Okay.

184
00:33:02,207 --> 00:33:04,713
Let the medicine do its work.

185
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:06,577
That should be as good as new.

186
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:11,285
Thank you for the sweets,
by the way.

187
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,624
I got these.

188
00:33:20,427 --> 00:33:23,363
I hope they're okay.
It's the best I could do.

189
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:43,185
I like them.

190
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,485
Thank you.

191
00:33:48,284 --> 00:33:49,686
You're welcome.

192
00:34:05,674 --> 00:34:06,835
Mm.

193
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:10,575
Smells good.

194
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,618
So much better than porridge.

195
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:25,590
That, young lady,
is a matter of opinion.

196
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,571
What?

197
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:21,415
What's happening?

198
00:35:23,116 --> 00:35:24,586
Get in the bathroom.

199
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,819
Lock the door.

200
00:35:25,855 --> 00:35:27,088
Don't make a sound.

201
00:35:27,123 --> 00:35:29,049
Don't come out until
I come for you.

202
00:35:30,727 --> 00:35:32,129
Do it, Jessie.

203
00:35:38,898 --> 00:35:40,269
Stay.

204
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:16,397
Weapons free.
Kill target on sight.

205
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:36,121
Agh...

206
00:36:36,156 --> 00:36:39,361
Argh...

207
00:36:41,127 --> 00:36:42,496
Find this fucker.

208
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,725
Spread out. Box him in.

209
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:42,377
Drop it! Jesus Christ!

210
00:38:45,388 --> 00:38:48,083
I've found the girl.
Extracting her now.

211
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:51,460
Jack!

212
00:39:00,234 --> 00:39:02,130
Argh!

213
00:39:26,292 --> 00:39:28,222
Aaargh! Argh!

214
00:39:42,978 --> 00:39:44,007
Let me go!

215
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,552
Argh!

216
00:40:10,898 --> 00:40:12,574
Who is that? Who?

217
00:40:16,377 --> 00:40:18,074
Who... who are these guys?

218
00:40:29,521 --> 00:40:30,993
Who... yeah, who are...?

219
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,621
I need you to wait here.

220
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:34,091
Nothing's gonna happen.

221
00:40:34,493 --> 00:40:35,795
I'm coming right back.

222
00:40:37,333 --> 00:40:39,029
But... but where are you going?

223
00:41:15,302 --> 00:41:16,935
Sorry, old boy.

224
00:41:37,493 --> 00:41:40,453
I'm off the reservation.
With baggage.

225
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,962
Okay, I'll be there.

226
00:41:51,505 --> 00:41:53,406
It's time to leave.

227
00:41:53,442 --> 00:41:55,879
But w-what about Jack?

228
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:57,210
Come on.

229
00:41:57,245 --> 00:41:59,274
Wha... what? What?

230
00:42:00,116 --> 00:42:01,518
Jack? No, no!

231
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:04,811
Jack?

232
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,987
Come on, we need to leave.

233
00:42:25,341 --> 00:42:26,873
Alpha team, come in.

234
00:42:29,805 --> 00:42:31,009
They're all gone.

235
00:42:32,141 --> 00:42:34,075
Who the hell is this guy?

236
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,816
Whoever he is,
he's not Tchermoev.

237
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:39,655
Who's our nearest
tier-one asset?

238
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,989
Workman.

239
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,593
Activate him.

240
00:42:48,029 --> 00:42:51,095
And notify all QRF teams
in the region to be on standby.

241
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:54,263
Find out who that girl is.

242
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:31,740
Come on!

243
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:40,480
- You're hurt!
- I'll be fine.

244
00:43:40,515 --> 00:43:42,113
But... but you're bleeding.

245
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:43,884
Come on.

246
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:01,132
Stay behind me.

247
00:44:09,073 --> 00:44:11,571
I need to check something.
Wait here.

248
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,787
I need to go inside.

249
00:44:26,823 --> 00:44:28,196
Get the keys.

250
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,958
You mean steal them?

251
00:44:29,993 --> 00:44:32,526
Hey, I need you to wait here.

252
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:36,299
Ever use a gun?

253
00:44:37,168 --> 00:44:39,703
I shot squirrels
with my uncle's air rifle.

254
00:44:39,738 --> 00:44:41,604
Good enough. Hold this.

255
00:44:41,939 --> 00:44:44,137
One hand there, and one there.

256
00:44:44,172 --> 00:44:45,877
Hold it tight against your body.

257
00:44:45,912 --> 00:44:47,745
Keep the barrel pointed
to the dirt.

258
00:44:47,781 --> 00:44:49,481
Keep your finger
off the trigger.

259
00:44:49,516 --> 00:44:50,786
It's sensitive.

260
00:44:51,685 --> 00:44:53,547
Get your back against the fence.

261
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:03,518
Hey, hey.

262
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:05,960
That's as far as you go.

263
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,592
Put it down.

264
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:16,696
Please.

265
00:46:18,506 --> 00:46:20,343
Whoa!

266
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:23,813
Let's... let's go slow, hey?

267
00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:28,147
He's hurt. Can you help him?

268
00:46:35,953 --> 00:46:37,484
What am I looking at?

269
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:40,392
Timur Tchermoev.
His profile's been altered.

270
00:46:40,427 --> 00:46:41,658
See here?

271
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:44,927
The code's been manipulated
to hide someone else.

272
00:46:45,396 --> 00:46:48,235
So, when a camera captures
the real person...

273
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,363
Mm-hmm.

274
00:46:49,399 --> 00:46:51,403
It misidentifies him
as Tchermoev.

275
00:46:51,772 --> 00:46:53,506
It's very sophisticated stuff.

276
00:46:53,875 --> 00:46:55,937
Whoever did this
used self-deleting code.

277
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:02,610
That's our guy.

278
00:47:03,244 --> 00:47:05,188
Michael Mason.

279
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:06,715
He's one of ours?

280
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:07,980
Yeah.

281
00:47:08,382 --> 00:47:10,124
But there aren't many details.

282
00:47:10,493 --> 00:47:12,393
He... he was orphaned.

283
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,359
Former SBS operator.

284
00:47:14,728 --> 00:47:16,595
K.I.A. ten years ago.

285
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:17,790
Apparently not.

286
00:47:19,466 --> 00:47:22,770
Why would someone want to frame
one of our own to be targeted?

287
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:24,535
I don't know.

288
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:25,839
Whoa.

289
00:47:26,175 --> 00:47:29,544
I... I just tried to access
his mission logs from Poole,

290
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,575
and I got this.

291
00:47:36,016 --> 00:47:38,248
Okay, keep digging.

292
00:47:38,284 --> 00:47:39,986
<i>There's a man
and a girl in our house.</i>

293
00:47:40,022 --> 00:47:42,419
Oh, the ops room just
intercepted a 999 call

294
00:47:42,454 --> 00:47:45,586
from a farm in Scotland,
matching Mason and our girl.

295
00:47:45,621 --> 00:47:48,327
Call the ops room.
Let them know I'm on my way.

296
00:47:48,997 --> 00:47:51,057
- We're all good, sir.
- Thank you, Ross.

297
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,715
Shit.

298
00:48:20,027 --> 00:48:22,498
<i>They have guns.
Please help.</i>

299
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:24,094
<i>They're holding my father.</i>

300
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:25,632
Our target is not
who we thought.

301
00:48:25,668 --> 00:48:26,968
His name is Michael Mason.

302
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:28,594
I want him caught
and brought in for questioning.

303
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:30,362
- Where's my asset?
- Workman's en route.

304
00:48:30,397 --> 00:48:31,732
<i>Please, please help.</i>

305
00:48:33,408 --> 00:48:35,111
Workman.

306
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:36,345
Good.

307
00:49:15,617 --> 00:49:17,250
Fuck you, Mason.

308
00:49:22,124 --> 00:49:24,455
I'm... I'm not sure how good
this will hold.

309
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,759
I've only stitched goats
and sheep.

310
00:49:27,795 --> 00:49:29,091
I'm sure it's good.

311
00:49:29,126 --> 00:49:30,690
Thanks.

312
00:49:30,725 --> 00:49:32,298
- We'll get out of your hair.
- Okay.

313
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,010
I'm gonna need your truck.

314
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:43,771
Keys are by the front door.

315
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:46,471
Go grab them, start it up.

316
00:49:46,807 --> 00:49:48,677
I don't want you to hurt them.

317
00:49:49,818 --> 00:49:52,318
I'm not gonna hurt them. Okay?

318
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,520
Where's your son?

319
00:49:57,624 --> 00:49:58,654
Callum!

320
00:50:00,825 --> 00:50:01,998
Callum!

321
00:50:09,332 --> 00:50:11,271
Did you just go do something?

322
00:50:14,806 --> 00:50:15,968
Callum?

323
00:50:17,009 --> 00:50:18,543
I called the police.

324
00:50:25,587 --> 00:50:26,880
Let's move.

325
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,118
Come.

326
00:50:29,153 --> 00:50:30,889
Sit there. Don't move.

327
00:50:38,198 --> 00:50:39,492
Local authorities are responding

328
00:50:39,528 --> 00:50:41,461
to a home invasion at the farm.

329
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,129
Well, tell them not to engage.

330
00:50:43,465 --> 00:50:44,869
Hold a perimeter.

331
00:50:45,272 --> 00:50:48,435
Do not engage.
I repeat do not engage!

332
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:49,971
We have personnel en route.

333
00:50:52,476 --> 00:50:54,476
- Police!
- Are they going to arrest you?

334
00:50:54,512 --> 00:50:56,580
It's not the police
I'm worried about.

335
00:50:57,282 --> 00:50:59,481
This way. Go, go, go.

336
00:50:59,516 --> 00:51:01,653
Hey, hey, wait.
Don't open the door!

337
00:51:02,022 --> 00:51:03,356
I live here...

338
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,697
Find out
where those shots came from!

339
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:17,705
I'm sorry.

340
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,339
You need to stay here.

341
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:21,506
Come on.

342
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,544
He's inside!

343
00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:25,609
Police!

344
00:51:28,015 --> 00:51:28,847
Argh!

345
00:51:28,883 --> 00:51:30,044
Put the weapon down!

346
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:34,389
Drop the weapon!

347
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:37,423
- Agh! Argh!
- Ugh! Urgh...

348
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:42,890
Come on.

349
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:44,694
Huh, uh!

350
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,174
Hey, police. Stop!

351
00:51:57,209 --> 00:51:59,580
- Aargh!
- Drop the weapon!

352
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:02,682
One to echo.
We have multiple men down.

353
00:52:06,617 --> 00:52:07,920
<i>They're rolling out.</i>

354
00:52:07,955 --> 00:52:09,023
<i>Hold your ground...</i>

355
00:52:09,058 --> 00:52:10,153
Get in the back.
Keep your head down.

356
00:52:10,188 --> 00:52:11,556
<i>Get on Mason!</i>

357
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:13,562
Patch me through to Workman!

358
00:52:15,592 --> 00:52:17,193
He's turned off his comms.

359
00:52:17,229 --> 00:52:18,728
What the fuck is going on?

360
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:21,200
Stay down and hold on.

361
00:52:33,374 --> 00:52:35,910
<i>Bravo two-one, we
need backup immediately!</i>

362
00:54:04,508 --> 00:54:05,835
Ah! Uh...

363
00:54:18,216 --> 00:54:19,618
Agh!

364
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,479
Ugh!

365
00:55:42,235 --> 00:55:43,537
We're switching cars.

366
00:55:44,102 --> 00:55:45,033
Let's go.

367
00:56:17,705 --> 00:56:19,136
Excuse me.

368
00:56:19,172 --> 00:56:20,508
Are you okay?

369
00:56:27,513 --> 00:56:29,742
Sir, stand still...

370
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:55,276
<i>Hello, Roberta.</i>

371
00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:57,578
You calling to rub salt
in the wound?

372
00:56:58,014 --> 00:56:59,113
<i>Hardly, sir.</i>

373
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:00,973
<i>For what it's worth,
I think the Prime Minister</i>

374
00:57:01,009 --> 00:57:03,042
<i>sacking you was a grave misstep.</i>

375
00:57:03,077 --> 00:57:04,850
Flattery will get you
everywhere.

376
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:06,514
<i>How can I help you?</i>

377
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:10,217
Does the name Michael Mason
ring any bells?

378
00:57:14,328 --> 00:57:15,897
Where did you hear that name?

379
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,467
He took down a full
assault team...

380
00:57:19,098 --> 00:57:20,128
alone.

381
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:25,238
<i>What I'm about to say
doesn't exist</i>

382
00:57:25,274 --> 00:57:27,542
<i>outside of this conversation.</i>

383
00:57:28,938 --> 00:57:31,907
Years ago,
we ran an off-book program

384
00:57:31,942 --> 00:57:35,813
of elite operatives
called Black Kites.

385
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:39,845
<i>Operatives untethered
from MI6's oversight.</i>

386
00:57:39,881 --> 00:57:41,485
And Mason was one of them.

387
00:57:41,521 --> 00:57:43,886
<i>Yeah. He was one of the first.</i>

388
00:57:43,922 --> 00:57:48,629
He was a prodigy.
He became our gold standard.

389
00:57:49,263 --> 00:57:50,391
Then what happened?

390
00:57:50,693 --> 00:57:51,990
<i>He was sent to eliminate</i>

391
00:57:52,026 --> 00:57:53,563
a foreign intelligence officer.

392
00:57:53,598 --> 00:57:55,437
Instead, he spared the target,

393
00:57:55,473 --> 00:57:58,732
<i>falsified his report,
and then disappeared.</i>

394
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,300
Why would he defy orders?

395
00:58:01,209 --> 00:58:02,943
We think he was turned.

396
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:05,977
<i>I'm sure for a king's ransom.</i>

397
00:58:06,547 --> 00:58:09,775
You need to understand
something.

398
00:58:11,077 --> 00:58:13,781
Mason isn't just an assassin.

399
00:58:13,816 --> 00:58:16,189
<i>He's a precision instrument.</i>

400
00:58:16,224 --> 00:58:18,286
<i>There's no stopping him.</i>

401
00:58:18,321 --> 00:58:22,323
You need to throw everything
you've got at him, Roberta.

402
00:58:22,825 --> 00:58:24,795
Michael Mason unfortunately

403
00:58:24,831 --> 00:58:28,933
has become a cancer
on all that we stand for.

404
00:58:32,567 --> 00:58:33,734
Yes, sir.

405
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,186
Ready to put your trade craft
to the test?

406
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:56,565
Am I gonna get fired for this?

407
00:58:57,693 --> 00:58:58,996
Not unless I do.

408
00:59:02,804 --> 00:59:05,935
I found the Black Kite files
on a backup server.

409
00:59:05,971 --> 00:59:09,006
Mason was helping
an Iranian scientist defect

410
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:11,745
after he gave us everything
on their nuclear program.

411
00:59:12,776 --> 00:59:14,515
Instead of protecting him,

412
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,311
Mason was ordered to kill him
for deniability.

413
00:59:18,385 --> 00:59:19,918
It looks like he refused.

414
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,725
Good girl, Maddie.

415
00:59:32,893 --> 00:59:34,527
Damn it, Roberta.

416
00:59:35,163 --> 00:59:37,705
Some people just can't
help themselves.

417
00:59:54,649 --> 00:59:55,789
You okay?

418
01:00:00,594 --> 01:00:01,990
You think I can't handle
the truth

419
01:00:02,025 --> 01:00:04,193
about who you really are,
but I can.

420
01:00:16,941 --> 01:00:20,242
Well... do you have family
somewhere?

421
01:00:25,185 --> 01:00:26,149
No.

422
01:00:28,587 --> 01:00:30,054
You never wanted one?

423
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:33,420
A wife, kids?

424
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:40,592
It complicates things.

425
01:00:46,575 --> 01:00:48,809
I'd rather it be complicated,
then.

426
01:00:50,037 --> 01:00:51,647
And have my mum back.

427
01:00:53,215 --> 01:00:54,573
My uncle too.

428
01:00:55,481 --> 01:00:56,982
Now I have no one.

429
01:01:00,383 --> 01:01:03,087
I wish I could tell you
life would always be fair.

430
01:01:04,153 --> 01:01:06,420
But you already know the truth
to that.

431
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:12,294
No kid should have to go through
what you did.

432
01:01:16,903 --> 01:01:19,136
Just don't ever let it break
your spirit.

433
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,468
No matter what.

434
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:24,207
Okay?

435
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,805
Here.

436
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:54,039
At least you had Jack.

437
01:01:55,773 --> 01:01:57,306
He was your family.

438
01:02:02,142 --> 01:02:03,246
Better you keep it.

439
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:33,914
Okay, there's a camera up
on the wall in front of us.

440
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:36,617
There's also one behind us.

441
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:38,378
I want you to get out
on my side,

442
01:02:38,413 --> 01:02:40,580
keep your head down
and keep it forward.

443
01:03:59,162 --> 01:04:01,331
So, when did you find religion?

444
01:04:02,468 --> 01:04:03,663
Today...

445
01:04:04,572 --> 01:04:05,874
when a ghost called me.

446
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:11,544
Oh, we have different
interpretations

447
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:13,178
of what "baggage" means.

448
01:04:14,481 --> 01:04:15,807
Just saying.

449
01:05:07,902 --> 01:05:10,571
Uh, no, that's the workshop.
Um...

450
01:05:10,906 --> 01:05:13,172
I'm always building
one thing or another.

451
01:05:13,207 --> 01:05:16,076
Just be careful, though,
there's lots of tools about.

452
01:05:19,975 --> 01:05:21,279
Uh, Jessie?

453
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:23,744
Why don't you go get a drink?

454
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:25,915
The kitchen's in the back.

455
01:05:26,417 --> 01:05:28,181
If you want me to leave
so you guys can talk,

456
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:29,782
you can just say that.

457
01:05:32,922 --> 01:05:34,688
Hey, hey...

458
01:05:36,398 --> 01:05:37,691
It's okay.

459
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:45,534
Spirited girl.

460
01:05:48,371 --> 01:05:50,277
Who is she?
What are you doing here?

461
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:53,245
Her uncle and I,
we served together.

462
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:56,743
I need a way out... for her.

463
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,451
Then I'll start figuring out
how they found me.

464
01:06:01,354 --> 01:06:03,989
Don't tell me you've got
sentimental in your old age?

465
01:06:04,024 --> 01:06:05,354
She's just a kid

466
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:07,787
who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

467
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:09,921
Christ, Mason...

468
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:58,610
Meet THEA.

469
01:06:59,179 --> 01:07:01,643
I helped build it
before I left the circus.

470
01:07:02,343 --> 01:07:04,178
The big question is...

471
01:07:04,681 --> 01:07:07,278
how the hell did they find you
after I buried you?

472
01:07:10,953 --> 01:07:12,291
Shit.

473
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,901
When it was time for you
to disappear, I...

474
01:07:22,337 --> 01:07:26,236
I changed your identity
to an oil worker in Aberdeen.

475
01:07:26,271 --> 01:07:28,643
A nobody.
But someone figured it out,

476
01:07:28,678 --> 01:07:30,377
and swapped it to this guy.

477
01:07:31,046 --> 01:07:33,311
A high-value terrorist
on the watch list.

478
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:36,216
Which you know carries
an interagency kill order.

479
01:07:40,114 --> 01:07:41,381
Manafort.

480
01:07:41,784 --> 01:07:43,623
You... you really think
he still wants you dead

481
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,093
after all this time?

482
01:07:45,962 --> 01:07:47,990
I broke the only rule
that matters to him.

483
01:07:48,025 --> 01:07:49,424
Fuck his rules.

484
01:07:49,459 --> 01:07:51,460
You refused to kill
an innocent man,

485
01:07:51,496 --> 01:07:54,366
that you promised to help
after he helped us.

486
01:07:55,297 --> 01:07:56,599
Can you shut it down?

487
01:07:56,902 --> 01:07:58,403
Not from here.

488
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:03,541
I mean, it wouldn't matter
anyway. You've been ID'd.

489
01:08:04,044 --> 01:08:05,875
All those years on that island.

490
01:08:06,344 --> 01:08:08,281
You should have stayed dead,
Mason.

491
01:08:08,849 --> 01:08:10,350
Yeah, that's my problem.

492
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,044
I just need you to keep
Jessie safe.

493
01:08:14,889 --> 01:08:17,016
Manafort knows who she is now...

494
01:08:17,518 --> 01:08:19,050
which makes her a loose end.

495
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:22,922
You care about her, don't you?

496
01:08:26,428 --> 01:08:28,103
This is where we part ways.

497
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:32,305
Can you keep her here?

498
01:08:33,908 --> 01:08:36,705
Look, Mason, I... I can't.

499
01:08:38,348 --> 01:08:39,444
Why?

500
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:43,217
He has cancer.

501
01:08:46,286 --> 01:08:48,654
My mum took the same meds
before she...

502
01:08:55,558 --> 01:08:57,561
I'm sorry I'm such a drag
to you.

503
01:08:58,931 --> 01:09:00,259
Hey, Jessie, wait.

504
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:05,932
Is she right?

505
01:09:07,968 --> 01:09:10,310
Doctors say I might get
one more Christmas.

506
01:09:11,613 --> 01:09:13,181
Oh, Jesus.

507
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:16,107
I'd help you if I could.

508
01:09:17,384 --> 01:09:19,444
But you know I can't be
responsible for her.

509
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:21,156
My hands are tied.

510
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:27,327
What if I go to Kamal?

511
01:09:28,964 --> 01:09:30,924
He has the means
to get her out...

512
01:09:31,493 --> 01:09:33,561
- undetected.
- Kamal Shah?

513
01:09:33,596 --> 01:09:36,562
No. No, no, no way.

514
01:09:36,598 --> 01:09:37,937
- Not an option!
- Hey, look.

515
01:09:37,972 --> 01:09:39,601
He's the best at what he does.

516
01:09:39,636 --> 01:09:41,407
Yeah, because
he's a violent trafficker.

517
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:44,745
And you haven't got MI6
behind you to control him now.

518
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,544
Let me worry about that.

519
01:09:47,277 --> 01:09:48,777
Just help me get to him.

520
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:51,945
Can you do that?

521
01:09:54,852 --> 01:09:58,358
Listen, I... I can tell you
when to turn left or right.

522
01:10:00,124 --> 01:10:01,658
That's about it.

523
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,155
Good enough.

524
01:10:45,336 --> 01:10:48,276
Hey, Jessie. It's time to go.

525
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:54,612
Hey, Jessie, come on.

526
01:10:57,053 --> 01:10:59,386
Were you really gonna
leave me here?

527
01:11:00,722 --> 01:11:01,883
I'm sorry.

528
01:11:03,424 --> 01:11:06,019
Your safety is the most
important thing to me.

529
01:11:09,763 --> 01:11:10,925
Please.

530
01:11:13,503 --> 01:11:14,467
Fine.

531
01:11:23,509 --> 01:11:24,673
- Go stand by the wall.
- But...

532
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:26,908
Just do it!
Stand by the wall.

533
01:12:14,729 --> 01:12:15,787
Jesus!

534
01:12:15,823 --> 01:12:17,293
Hurgh!

535
01:12:17,328 --> 01:12:19,624
Aaargh!

536
01:12:19,659 --> 01:12:21,968
- Urgh!
- Argh!

537
01:12:22,003 --> 01:12:23,602
Ooh!

538
01:12:33,308 --> 01:12:34,408
Argh!

539
01:13:46,646 --> 01:13:47,950
Let him go.

540
01:13:50,488 --> 01:13:52,119
Just let him go.

541
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,160
Argh!

542
01:13:59,559 --> 01:14:00,699
Come on!

543
01:14:07,034 --> 01:14:10,577
Get here in now, go!
Go, go, get in!

544
01:14:28,698 --> 01:14:30,124
Jesus!

545
01:14:31,593 --> 01:14:32,896
Who was that?

546
01:14:33,362 --> 01:14:34,425
Him.

547
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:35,998
20 years ago.

548
01:15:02,259 --> 01:15:03,190
Ross?

549
01:15:05,731 --> 01:15:07,735
We're doubling down,
get your team ready.

550
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:08,932
Yes, sir.

551
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:19,307
The Wi-Fi in there
will suffice for my needs.

552
01:15:19,676 --> 01:15:21,874
Here, take my hat and coat.

553
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:23,751
Help you hide those good looks.

554
01:15:23,786 --> 01:15:24,882
Right.

555
01:15:25,451 --> 01:15:27,312
Use only for an emergency,

556
01:15:27,347 --> 01:15:30,184
or you know they'll trace you
in a heartbeat.

557
01:15:31,757 --> 01:15:33,490
Yeah, we're gonna
have to switch motors.

558
01:15:33,525 --> 01:15:35,222
They know we're in this one now.

559
01:15:39,597 --> 01:15:41,228
You take care, young lady.

560
01:15:42,267 --> 01:15:43,464
Thank you.

561
01:16:00,948 --> 01:16:02,854
I wish you'd killed that man.

562
01:16:05,658 --> 01:16:07,925
I know it's wrong to say that,
but...

563
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:12,996
Maybe I'm becoming like you.

564
01:16:15,634 --> 01:16:17,396
You're nothing like me, Jessie.

565
01:16:18,306 --> 01:16:20,003
And I'm keeping it that way.

566
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,041
But how do you know?

567
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:28,440
Because I've seen
who you really are.

568
01:16:32,215 --> 01:16:36,550
Look... by tonight, all of this
will be behind you.

569
01:16:36,852 --> 01:16:38,584
You'll start a brand-new life...

570
01:16:39,087 --> 01:16:41,123
somewhere normal,
somewhere safe.

571
01:16:42,591 --> 01:16:44,093
And alone.

572
01:16:48,202 --> 01:16:49,560
What will you do?

573
01:16:51,605 --> 01:16:53,531
You can't go back
to your island.

574
01:16:54,606 --> 01:16:56,611
There's always another island.

575
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:07,886
I could come with you.

576
01:17:12,425 --> 01:17:13,985
You don't want this life.

577
01:17:14,455 --> 01:17:17,591
Always on the run,
looking over your shoulder...

578
01:17:17,626 --> 01:17:18,762
And you do?

579
01:17:18,797 --> 01:17:20,393
Hey, Jessie,
you need to understand.

580
01:17:21,295 --> 01:17:23,497
The only way that I can
protect you...

581
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:26,564
is to stop the people
that are doing this.

582
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:30,463
You need to stay close to me,
all right?

583
01:18:53,492 --> 01:18:55,118
Any sign of Mason?

584
01:18:55,154 --> 01:18:57,861
No. We have nothing.

585
01:18:57,897 --> 01:18:59,767
<i>He knows what he's doing.</i>

586
01:19:00,994 --> 01:19:02,269
You're right.

587
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:06,704
I found an unknown login to
THEA from outside MI6.

588
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:08,339
<i>I have a bad feeling.</i>

589
01:19:08,374 --> 01:19:09,669
Can you ID?

590
01:19:09,704 --> 01:19:10,703
<i>No.</i>

591
01:19:11,405 --> 01:19:14,774
There is... there is
something I can try.

592
01:19:15,176 --> 01:19:17,250
Whatever it is, do it quickly.

593
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:36,364
There's a camera.
It'll see us.

594
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:39,037
Let's hope it's working.

595
01:19:43,774 --> 01:19:45,906
Sorry, mate. Invite only.

596
01:19:49,579 --> 01:19:50,877
Aargh!

597
01:19:50,912 --> 01:19:52,145
Take me to Kamal,

598
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:53,583
or I'll break your other wrist.

599
01:20:11,604 --> 01:20:13,302
Well played, Roberta.

600
01:20:13,805 --> 01:20:15,810
My trap worked. I got him.

601
01:20:17,376 --> 01:20:18,813
It's...

602
01:20:20,412 --> 01:20:21,675
Oh, shit.

603
01:20:22,078 --> 01:20:24,217
- That's...
- Stephen Manafort.

604
01:20:27,051 --> 01:20:29,120
I know.
We'll deal with him later.

605
01:20:31,584 --> 01:20:35,593
Get me every camera
in this club, now!

606
01:20:46,466 --> 01:20:48,843
Let's keep this walk
nice and smooth.

607
01:21:25,272 --> 01:21:27,178
Tell him it's Michael Mason.

608
01:21:45,635 --> 01:21:47,330
Do you know Michael Mason, boss?

609
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:11,849
Michael Mason.

610
01:22:12,591 --> 01:22:13,752
Look at you.

611
01:22:15,321 --> 01:22:17,364
No country, no badge.

612
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:22,233
Just a poor bastard who thought
he had friends in the game.

613
01:22:25,241 --> 01:22:26,534
Who's she?

614
01:22:28,037 --> 01:22:29,375
I need a way out...

615
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,540
of the country for
her. Tonight.

616
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:36,082
New identity.
Somewhere off grid.

617
01:22:37,450 --> 01:22:38,811
No.

618
01:22:38,847 --> 01:22:39,813
No?

619
01:22:40,582 --> 01:22:41,822
How do you think you've been
allowed to operate

620
01:22:41,857 --> 01:22:44,885
for all these years, Kamal?
With impunity.

621
01:22:45,721 --> 01:22:48,593
And with the luxury of
getting rid of your competition

622
01:22:48,628 --> 01:22:49,957
at the same time.

623
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,462
By ratting them out to
Manafort and I.

624
01:22:55,602 --> 01:22:56,795
Manafort's gone.

625
01:22:57,702 --> 01:22:59,006
Not gone...

626
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:00,532
unshackled.

627
01:23:00,567 --> 01:23:03,670
He's more dangerous than
ever to us both.

628
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:07,009
- You're lying.
- Am I?

629
01:23:07,645 --> 01:23:10,348
The second the security camera
outside saw me walk in here,

630
01:23:10,384 --> 01:23:15,919
into your club, every operative
MI6 has within 25 miles

631
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:18,617
was activated to bring me in.

632
01:23:18,652 --> 01:23:21,960
I reckon you've got
ten minutes, tops.

633
01:23:21,996 --> 01:23:24,391
All I need is for you
to get her out.

634
01:23:24,426 --> 01:23:26,429
And I'll go cut the head
off the snake.

635
01:23:27,562 --> 01:23:29,861
Bury all our dirty little
secrets with him.

636
01:23:34,167 --> 01:23:36,268
Wait here.

637
01:23:52,253 --> 01:23:54,028
Please come with me.

638
01:23:55,688 --> 01:23:57,526
You heard the deal
I made with him.

639
01:23:59,194 --> 01:24:00,994
I need to honor my side.

640
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:02,795
Honor your side?

641
01:24:06,432 --> 01:24:08,169
I think you wanna die.

642
01:24:08,204 --> 01:24:09,641
What's that supposed to mean?

643
01:24:10,144 --> 01:24:12,640
You don't think you have
anything to live for.

644
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,845
If you really wanted to,
you'd come!

645
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:21,088
Hey, people like me don't
get to go and live a normal life!

646
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:23,684
You keep telling yourself that.

647
01:24:31,523 --> 01:24:32,892
Hey, hey...

648
01:24:33,661 --> 01:24:36,260
- You're stronger than this.
- No, I'm not.

649
01:24:36,296 --> 01:24:37,170
Yes, you are.

650
01:24:39,398 --> 01:24:40,932
I need you to be.

651
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:44,936
Just promise me you're not
going to die?

652
01:24:50,143 --> 01:24:51,382
Exactly.

653
01:24:59,588 --> 01:25:01,219
Right, where's my tactical team?

654
01:25:01,688 --> 01:25:03,359
- En route.
- I want Mason and the girl

655
01:25:03,394 --> 01:25:06,100
taken in alive.
They are not to open fire.

656
01:25:07,331 --> 01:25:09,460
Car's out front.

657
01:25:09,495 --> 01:25:10,704
How far out is your team?

658
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:12,469
They're still en route, sir.

659
01:25:13,235 --> 01:25:14,969
Where the fuck are you?

660
01:25:16,744 --> 01:25:18,041
Thirty seconds out, sir.

661
01:25:18,077 --> 01:25:19,570
The girl is his Achilles' heel.

662
01:25:19,605 --> 01:25:21,207
Use that to your advantage.

663
01:25:21,242 --> 01:25:22,446
Copy that, sir.

664
01:25:30,683 --> 01:25:33,587
Passport, ID and 20,000 euros.

665
01:25:33,622 --> 01:25:35,822
She goes to our safe house
in Spain for now.

666
01:25:36,925 --> 01:25:41,225
Boat leaves Isle of Dogs
in 30 minutes. It won't wait.

667
01:25:41,861 --> 01:25:44,161
Just make sure you finish
what you started.

668
01:25:44,864 --> 01:25:48,441
If you handle your end,
I'll handle mine.

669
01:25:59,482 --> 01:26:01,246
Wait on the other side
of the square.

670
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:03,751
Let's move. All
right, let's go.

671
01:26:08,963 --> 01:26:10,591
This is Zulu, two minutes out.

672
01:26:10,626 --> 01:26:12,229
<i>Do we have
an exact location inside?</i>

673
01:26:12,264 --> 01:26:13,765
Wait, you're not already there?

674
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:15,131
<i>That's a negative.</i>

675
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:21,766
Manafort. Tell them that there's
a rogue team already inside.

676
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:24,205
They need to get in
there now! Now!

677
01:26:57,207 --> 01:26:59,503
Argh!

678
01:27:43,757 --> 01:27:45,259
It's okay.

679
01:27:49,161 --> 01:27:50,829
Argh!

680
01:28:58,127 --> 01:28:59,366
Argh!

681
01:29:19,121 --> 01:29:22,117
Get out of here!
Move out of the way!

682
01:29:23,790 --> 01:29:25,150
Mason!

683
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:27,053
Mason!

684
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:37,470
Arthur. Manafort's guards
have got Jessie.

685
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:41,332
Move, move, move.
Out of the way! Out the way!

686
01:29:41,701 --> 01:29:43,410
Found her. Hold on.

687
01:29:44,869 --> 01:29:46,179
Out the front entrance.

688
01:29:46,215 --> 01:29:47,811
Cut across the square
and turn south.

689
01:29:47,846 --> 01:29:50,714
<i>She's being carried
towards a black transit van.</i>

690
01:29:51,016 --> 01:29:52,144
Open it up!

691
01:29:52,847 --> 01:29:55,479
- I've got her! Move, move!
- Help me!

692
01:29:55,982 --> 01:29:57,690
Go, go, go!

693
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:58,816
Get ready!

694
01:29:58,851 --> 01:30:00,218
He's gonna be coming for her!

695
01:30:01,126 --> 01:30:02,322
Get in there!

696
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:06,491
Where are you going?
Get in there!

697
01:30:13,303 --> 01:30:14,507
I don't see Mason.

698
01:30:15,336 --> 01:30:16,667
There!

699
01:30:21,678 --> 01:30:23,340
<i>Mason's heading
right towards you.</i>

700
01:30:36,863 --> 01:30:37,863
Move!

701
01:30:48,204 --> 01:30:49,069
Move!

702
01:30:49,678 --> 01:30:50,634
Move!

703
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:51,775
Fucking move.

704
01:31:18,906 --> 01:31:19,935
I got you.

705
01:31:20,435 --> 01:31:21,607
It's okay.

706
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:25,006
I got you.

707
01:31:25,408 --> 01:31:26,678
I got you, Jessie.

708
01:31:29,246 --> 01:31:30,484
I got you.

709
01:31:36,087 --> 01:31:37,150
You okay?

710
01:31:38,051 --> 01:31:39,790
Time to go.

711
01:32:40,021 --> 01:32:41,313
There's your ride.

712
01:33:01,304 --> 01:33:02,400
Hey.

713
01:33:03,408 --> 01:33:04,776
You're gonna be okay.

714
01:33:07,079 --> 01:33:08,175
Come on.

715
01:33:14,251 --> 01:33:15,512
Come on.

716
01:33:16,817 --> 01:33:18,289
Gonna lower her down.

717
01:33:18,324 --> 01:33:19,791
You've gotta hurry!

718
01:33:21,022 --> 01:33:23,859
- Ready? It's time to go.
- No.

719
01:33:23,894 --> 01:33:27,027
- The boat won't wait.
- No, no, no. You...

720
01:33:27,329 --> 01:33:30,201
You said you can't live a
normal life, but you're wrong.

721
01:33:30,703 --> 01:33:32,161
You just have to come
on the boat with me

722
01:33:32,197 --> 01:33:33,735
and we can... we
can disappear

723
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:35,307
and we can have a normal life.

724
01:33:35,343 --> 01:33:36,968
- Come on.
- Please. No, please!

725
01:33:37,004 --> 01:33:38,034
- Please!
- The boat won't wait.

726
01:33:38,069 --> 01:33:39,976
You're all I have now!

727
01:33:43,778 --> 01:33:45,718
I don't wanna leave you.

728
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:49,650
Hey. Jessie.

729
01:33:49,685 --> 01:33:51,484
- No!
- Listen to me.

730
01:33:53,292 --> 01:33:54,818
- Jessie.
- No!

731
01:33:55,387 --> 01:33:58,324
This is the only way
I can keep you safe.

732
01:33:59,792 --> 01:34:01,094
I'm sorry.

733
01:34:01,129 --> 01:34:05,070
No! I'm not...
I'm not leaving without you!

734
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:10,072
I have to save you!

735
01:34:12,477 --> 01:34:14,109
You saved me already.

736
01:34:17,251 --> 01:34:19,015
You saved me already.

737
01:34:21,552 --> 01:34:23,022
Come on.

738
01:34:24,918 --> 01:34:26,583
- Now, Jessie!
- No!

739
01:34:27,559 --> 01:34:29,862
Okay, she's safe.

740
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:33,592
No, no, please!

741
01:35:20,978 --> 01:35:22,749
Do you even know why
you're doing this?

742
01:35:26,385 --> 01:35:27,820
Does it matter?

743
01:35:29,016 --> 01:35:30,680
You can't save her either.

744
01:36:19,936 --> 01:36:21,874
Argh!

745
01:37:03,213 --> 01:37:05,617
<i>Newly appointed MI6 head,
Roberta Frost,</i>

746
01:37:05,653 --> 01:37:07,348
<i>is dealing with the fallout...</i>

747
01:37:47,692 --> 01:37:49,786
You were my dearest...

748
01:37:51,333 --> 01:37:53,295
my greatest weapon.

749
01:37:55,702 --> 01:37:57,662
And then you broke the rules.

750
01:37:59,103 --> 01:38:04,233
Black Kites know one law
above all: loyalty.

751
01:38:05,002 --> 01:38:09,346
You put your conscience
first and the mission second.

752
01:38:10,016 --> 01:38:13,115
I finally put humanity
over blind obedience.

753
01:38:13,151 --> 01:38:16,484
Oh, yeah. There it is.
The righteous martyr.

754
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:19,857
And a foolish one. You
allowed a civilian into this game.

755
01:38:19,893 --> 01:38:22,484
A child! What good is
all that humanity

756
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,656
with her blood on your hands?

757
01:38:25,466 --> 01:38:26,856
That's not gonna happen.

758
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:29,232
And you know it.

759
01:38:34,838 --> 01:38:36,602
I don't want that either.

760
01:38:40,848 --> 01:38:43,950
You really think you can
outrun what you are?

761
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,614
We are who we are, Mason.

762
01:38:50,659 --> 01:38:52,957
I have been given complete
autonomy

763
01:38:52,992 --> 01:38:56,120
to make Black Kites
stronger than ever.

764
01:38:56,656 --> 01:39:00,725
I want you with me...
by my side, as we were.

765
01:39:04,568 --> 01:39:08,139
You're the very reason I didn't
pull the trigger ten years ago.

766
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:12,770
And why I have to now.

767
01:39:52,311 --> 01:39:54,581
What's up? Anything new?

768
01:39:55,747 --> 01:39:57,991
Just having some cocoa
and reading a book.

769
01:40:00,055 --> 01:40:01,691
Zoom in and up-res.

770
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:08,930
Er, maybe we should
start exploring

771
01:40:08,965 --> 01:40:10,498
other ways to find him.

772
01:40:11,772 --> 01:40:13,699
He hid from us for ten years...

773
01:40:14,441 --> 01:40:15,668
until her.

774
01:40:17,270 --> 01:40:18,770
It's a matter of when.

775
01:40:27,686 --> 01:40:28,945
Wait.

776
01:40:35,428 --> 01:40:36,722
It's him.

777
01:40:48,303 --> 01:40:49,999
Your friend said this was
for you.

778
01:41:12,065 --> 01:41:14,694
- Where is he?
- He was there a moment ago.
